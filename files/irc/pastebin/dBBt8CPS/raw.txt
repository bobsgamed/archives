Bob: terraria is procedurally generated
are you fucking serious
me: Yah
bob: what a joke
what a fucking scam this is
i could make this game in a month
me: Its only like 4000 lines of code in c#. 
bob: what a joke
the internet hates me because im not pretending to be humble
i was fucking homeless working on bobs game
thats real humility man
oh
dont feel weird
a lot of my friends are rich and it doesnt bother me
i had a lot of people offer to fund me and help me so its really my fault
and also i inherited some money last year and so i was able to move out here
me: Ah, cool
bob: but i spent it all ;-;
not that i really care, i am used to being broke
i havent made a single dollar since 2002
because im unemployable and stubborn :P
Andrew "Redigit" Spinks 
i know him
he wrote super mario x
OH SHIT
he was trying to get this on DS or something
nintendo canned his shit
me: Ya
bob: they sent him a c&d about smbx
then he put it on steam
terraria that is
that guy is probably pretty cool
well good for him
me: He is.
bob: my life is completely destroyed and im just going to go sit in my car in the garage
hahaha
I met Jeremy “Blue” Guerrette while working on my last project,
here it is 
older game industry guy swoops in and cashes in on the kid
ah hes not that old
but theres a lot of controversy around him
me: Yea
bob: but im probably right about that 
in this case its not so bad
they both probably deserve the success
ok

bob: hey so you know redigit?
i sent him a thing before terraria saying he should port smbx engine to nD
me: I don't know him personally, but I follow his twitter.
bob: ah
he added me on facebook after nintendo c&d'd him
i've got a pretty sizable "screwed by ninty" club going here! 
he is a really good friend from a past project
i'll see if he'll port terraria
