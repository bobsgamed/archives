</p>
<p class="font_11">Hello.<br>
My name is Bob, age 25.</p>
<p class="font_11">This is my game for Nintendo DS, a
  20-hour-long retail-size, <br>
  retail-quality adventure title by a single human being-<br>
  the largest game ever made by one person.</p>
<p class="font_11">"bob's game" is a simple 2D adventure
  game, with focus on <br>
  story, puzzles, item collection, and communication instead <br>
  of repetitive battles with palette-swapped enemies.</p>
<p class="font_11">Many characters (over 200 completely
  unique characters!) <br>
  have deep personalities that evolve, and many things <br>
  depend on the in-game time, day and weather. </p>
<p class="font_11">It's the game I wanted to play when I
  was younger, <br>
  a vision I've been following since then.</p>
<p class="font_11">-</p>
<p class="font_11">The game industry is evolving rapidly
  into a new era where <br>
  titles are made by teams of more than a hundred developers.</p>
<p class="font_11">I saw a window of opportunity quickly
  closing- what may be the <br>
  last chance for making a console game to be possible by a single
  individual.</p>
<p class="font_11">Even on a portable platform,
  singlehandedly creating something <br>
  generally made by large, well-funded teams was no small effort.</p>
<p class="font_11">All concepts, story, code, sprites,
  tiles, music, samples,<br>
  fonts, etc. were created entirely from scratch by me-<br>
  and I had to teach myself the skills as I went along.</p>
<p class="font_11">The code is straight C, the music is
  tracked, and the art is all <br>
  completely hand-clicked tiles and sprites- done the right way, <br>
  pixel by pixel, like the classics we all know and love.</p>
<p class="font_11">-</p>
<p class="font_11">"bob's game" is a sort of masterpiece
  for me.<br>
  I've invested well over 15,000 hours into <br>
  its development over 5 years of dedication-<br>
  That is no exaggeration, and it shows.</p>
<p class="font_11">I intend this to become one of the last
  great old-school <br>
  2D retail console games- truly the vision of a single mind.
  <br>
  <br>

  <em><strong>Coming soon for Google Android, Apple iPhone, and OpenPandora.</strong></em><br>
  (And Nintendo DS, of course!)<br>
  <em>Maybe  PSP, XBLA, and Steam! </em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>iPhone alone has already sold over 17 million systems, and Steve Jobs wasn't kidding about being a competitor.</strong><br>
  <em>It's like he's some kind of genius! </em><br>
  <br>
  They seem to think that developers are still powerless. <strong class="font_color2_11">Times have changed, Nintendo.</strong><br>
  I've repeatedly said that I don't care about the DS sales- because it's a broken platform and the profits are terrible!<br>
  I just wanted to see <em class="font_11"><strong>my box on the shelf. </strong></em> I already saw it on the shelf of the <em><strong>Nintendo World Store!</strong></em> ;}<br>
  <br>
  Of course, I want as many people to be able to play it as I can! <br>
  The only option left for me is to release it as homebrew- playable only on flash devices! <br>
  <br>
All it would take is a few hundred thousand people wanting to play
"bob's game" on Nintendo DS and it might start to bite into sales.<br>
  This has the potential to cause major damage not only to Nintendo, but to <em><strong>EVERY SINGLE LICENSED DEVELOPER FOR THE SYSTEM!</strong></em><br>
  <br>
  I'm not even a licensed developer, what do I care?<em><strong> NOT MY PROBLEM!</strong></em> <em>(I still don't want to do it!)</em><br>
  Last I heard, even those big developers were already getting pretty upset with you, Nintendo!<br>
  They've been abandoning your system for more open platforms- <strong>just like what happened to the N64.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <em>I wonder why all these <strong>evil developers</strong> are so angry at you, Nintendo? Why do they keep <strong>cracking your systems?!</strong></em><br>
  It's the only way they can develop on it! When are you going to figure it out? Something has to change!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>WHY WON'T YUU LOVE US, <span class="font_color1_11"><em>REGGIE?!</em></span></strong><strong><br>

  <br>
  I've been given a device that allows me to communicate with the aliens by amplifying the telepathic signal.<br>
That's really a relief for both of us. There's only so much you can
learn with a probe, apparently, so they've resorted to communication.<br>
  (That's just a little alien humor. ;} )<br>
  <br>
  So anyway, here's the deal. <br>
I'm supposed to give everybody a message, and they're giving me secrets
about Nintendo they've picked up on their thought network.<br>
  Here's what they wanted me to say. I'm not really sure about all of it, but it's the best I can understand it.<br>
  <br>
Supposedly, they came and talked to the leaders of some civilizations a
long time ago on different sides of the world, but they didn't really
understand anything they were told.<br>
Since they only communicate through telepathy, there were all these
guys running around saying they had "visions" and "prophecies" and most
of them got locked away. <br>
I guess this was back before they knew what gravity was, so that makes
sense. I can see that it would be hard to explain the origins of the
universe to people that think the earth is flat.<br>
  <br>
The only thing those leaders understood was that we're supposed to
build triangular polyhedron buildings so that our position is easier to
triangulate from another dimension when we die.<br>
  Sounds a little bit crazy to me, but 
  I guess we humans DO know there's another dimension and we just don't know how to use it yet.
  We're just now getting into that whole "spooky action" quantum thing.<br>
They told me it's what they use for the telepathic communication, and
we're all capable of it, something like a subconscious neural network.
Sounds cool enough.<br>
I don't really get the whole gist of it, but I'm sure there's some
stuff we haven't figured out yet, so I'm giving them the benefit of the
doubt. <br>
  <br>
They said something about implanting some guy with a
matter-manipulation module a couple thousand years ago, and everyone
got really upset about it. <br>
I guess that was some kind of test, and everyone really got the wrong
idea. They're on the fence about doing it again, they're still not sure
if we're ready.<br>
They think the best way might be to give it to a lot of people in a few
years instead of just one guy. That's all I know, I'll try to find out
more.<br>
Anyway, take this all with a grain of salt. I really don't know what
they're talking about, since they don't even communicate in English. <br>
  It's more like abstract thoughts get beamed into your head. Sort of like dreaming while you're awake. Really strange stuff.<br>
  <br>
As far as Nintendo goes, the aliens said Super Mario 128 is still in
development and Nintendo is probably going to show it at E3, along with
Metroid Dread and Kid Icarus.<br>
  That makes a lot of sense too, since  Super Mario Galaxy wasn't made by the regular team, it was made by the Jungle Beat guys.<br>
  I guess that Miyamoto fellow said the Wii was made for Super Mario 128, then he backpeddled and said it was cancelled.<br>
  I'm not sure how this helps me destroy them, but I suppose spoiling that guy's magnum opus will upset him at least.<br>
  I'll try to find out more details.
  Remember, it's not like I have any contacts with NCL. It's<em class="font_color2_11"><strong> aliens.</strong></em><br>

I am trying to negotiate with the aliens (through telepathic means, of
course) to bring me back to earth so that I can continue destroying
Nintendo.<br>
They seem to be confused about this, but they've given me my equipment
back so that I can keep working. They've also increased my webcam
bandwidth.<br>

  This is the end of my <strong class="font_color2_11">pitch</strong> to Nintendo of America- which <strong>Mr. Tom Prata, Senior Director of Project Development</strong>, authorized on Feb 22, 2008.<br>
  Thanks to all Nintendo staff and to Nintendo's PR department for allowing this to continue as long as it has.<br>
  <br>
  If Nintendo decides not to proceed, <span class="font_color2_11"><strong>"bob's game"</strong></span> will be released for iPhone, Android, and possibly OpenPandora, XBLA, Steam, and PSP.<br>
  I am a Nintendo fan, and I would like to see <span class="font_color2_11"><strong>"bob's game"</strong></span> released on the Nintendo DS more than any of these systems.<br>
  Please <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/webform.jsp">let Nintendo know</a> if Yuu would like to  support "bob's game" being released on the DS. <br>
  <br>
In this age of nearly infinite information flow and instant turnover,
getting a message out there is nearly impossible, even with millions of
dollars for advertising.<br>
  Yet I have succeeded at this and caught the attention of nearly the entire online gaming world- from <em>a locked room with a cell phone</em> and no budget whatsoever.<br>
  <br>
If this does not demonstrate to Nintendo the determination, passion,
creativity, and ingenuity that I am capable of, then I don't know what
will.<br>
  Unorthodox, of course. I had to do something completely new, something that hadn't been tried before- and it worked.<br>
  <span class="font_color2_11"><strong><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">bobsgame.com</b></strong></span> has now had over 1 million unique visitors. My mission has been a success. <br>

  It seems I've got Nintendo all wrong. They haven't abandoned their core gamers afterall.<br>
  Why, <em><strong>REGGIE</strong></em> himself is excited to play the fresh new Wii version of Pikmin. He must be a core gamer!<br>
  <br>
  Undoubtedly, they've been listening to their fans. That's exactly what we've all been asking for.<br>
  It's definitely not some kind of hasty, misguided attempt to fulfill what they seem to think their fans want. <br>
  <br>
  They couldn't possibly be <em><strong>so far out of touch with things</strong></em> that they'd try and satisfy us <br>
  with something as <em><strong>dull and boring</strong></em> as a new franchise or fulfilling promised titles like Mario 128.<br>
  <br>
  No, they're right on the money. They know what we're<em><strong> really</strong></em> asking for.<br>
  Pikmin with different controls, Animal Crossing with identical graphics, and Wii Music-<em> just what we wanted.</em><br>
  This is the very definition of <em><strong>HARDCORE.</strong></em> Hats off to you, Nintendo.<br>
  <br>
  I had Yuu all wrong, <em><strong><span class="font_color1_11">REGGIE!</span></strong></em><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Also, I've observed a new psychological phenomenon and coined a term for it. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>"Denioll"</strong> - When someone is "troled" <strong><em>SO HARD</em></strong> their brain completely rejects it and <br>
  puts them into a temporary, malfunctioning state of irrational excuse-seeking.<br>
  <br>
  I should win a Nobel prize for this discovery. ;}<br>

It was foolish of me to think Nintendo would hear my pleas. They're
just another heartless corporation, only interested in the biggest
profits.<br>
The core gamers don't matter anymore. It's not about the games or the
fans, it's about spreading out and getting casual gamers to buy Wii Fit.<br>
The golden days of video games are long gone. A game like mine has no
place on the shelf along with games like "Crossword Puzzles" and
"Sudoku." <strong><br>
  <br>
  </strong>Nintendo
sells all these games about "doing your best" and "being the hero,"
telling kids "you can do it if you try," but in the end that's just a
story, a marketing lie that sounds good.<br> That's business. That's
the real world. In reality, if Link approached the castle gate, a guard
would just throw him out. It doesn't matter how much <strong><em>courage</em></strong> he has.<br>
  It doesn't matter how <strong><em>talented</em></strong> he is with his sword, or how <strong><em>pure hearted</em></strong> he might be. He's wearing a <em><strong>dirty tunic and he has no credentials</strong></em>. <br>
  "Get out of here, you stupid kid." The evil kingdom of Ganon (Or should I say<em> "</em><span class="font_color1_111"><em><strong>Gantendo</strong></em></span><em>"</em>) spreads across the land, Zelda dies, and the credits scroll. Game over.<br>
  That's the real Nintendo, I guess.<br>
  <strong><br>
  <span class="font_color1_111">I've had enough. I'm ending the protest.</span></strong> I give up on getting the SDK. I really tried my best. Show's over. It's just not going to work.<br>
Sorry, everyone. I just can't stay in here. My head won't stop
pounding. I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's like I'm splitting in
half.<br>
I keep seeing these posts that I apparently wrote, but I can't remember
writing them. I'm afraid I'm becoming someone else entirely.<br>
  <br>
Nobody even takes me seriously anymore- how is Nintendo supposed to?
Everyone thinks it's some kind of viral ad. It's obviously not. I'm one
guy that can't get a break.<br>
Don't you think that maybe I might get a little angry being locked in
here for a month with no response? So maybe I have to joke around a
little to cheer myself up. Big deal.<br> I'll stay locked in for the rest of today to make an
even 30 days, and then the protest is over. I know I lost. I've been
completely disgraced and humiliated. <br>
I've been stepped on, pushed around, and trampled from all sides. It's
like trying to fight a machine with words, with an army mocking you the
whole time.<br>
  <br>
  It's OK, Nintendo. I'm trying not to blame you, I really am. It's just.. man, I was stupid to believe that stuff.<br>
  "Be a hero! You  can do it!" Yeah, right. "Throw away five years of your life." I guess that doesn't sell as well, huh?<br>
  <br>
  My head hurts, so I'm ending this post. Sorry, everybody. Whatever. Why does this <em>HURT</em> so much?! <br>

  <br>
  <img src="BobsGame_files/green.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"><br>
  <br>
I have been approached recently by a "homebrew device" manufacturer
that can secure a retail distribution deal with Wal-Mart and game
stores like GameStop.<br>
This is not unprecedented. There are already some homebrew devices in
retail stores, such as the Datel Max Media Drive, and the GBA Movie
Player by Nintendo themselves.<br>
  <br>
  "bob's game" could be sold on a microSD card, along with a DSi-enabled "homebrew device," <span class="font_color2_11"><strong>for less than the price of a high-budget DS title.</strong></span><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
This is much like what companies such as Galoob and Tengen did in the
past. "bob's game" would be sold with the memory cards and accessories,
similar to how "Game Genie" was distributed.<br>
  It's a way to get my game on the shelf- but I would rather not do this. <span class="font_color2_11">This is why I am protesting Nintendo to sell me what I need to publish through official means.</span><span class="font_color2_11"><br>
  </span><br>
This situation shouldn't even happen in the first place! The
competitors are reaching out towards independent developers and
embracing this new phenomenon.<br>
  Nintendo, on the other hand, is once again a sluggish dinosaur- and they're supposed to be the ones driving innovation!<br>
I believe Nintendo is once again losing touch with its fans, similar to
what happened at the height of the original NES' popularity.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <img src="BobsGame_files/green.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"><br>
  <br>
  Why is Nintendo releasing the DSi?<br>
  It has a few extra features, yes- but there is much debate over whether these features justify buying a whole new console.<br>
The primary purpose of the DSi is probably as a countermeasure to
battle the compatibility and availability of "homebrew-enabling
devices."<br>
  <br>
  Why would Nintendo need to do this? They're "printing money," aren't they?<br>
  Nintendo reportedly only makes <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nintendo+wii+$6+unit">$6 per Wii unit sold</a>, and believe it or not- third party Wii sales are <em><strong>not satisfactory!</strong><br>
  </em>The
highest selling games are all by Nintendo themselves- this is fine for
a software company, but not for a console manufacturer.<br>
  It's the third party sales that generate the profit Nintendo needs to stay afloat!<br>
  <br>
  In other words, Nintendo makes a very significant portion of their revenue from the sale of third-party DS titles.<br>
Unfortunately, these sales are being affected by the recent popularity
of "homebrew devices," and Nintendo has attempted to crack down on
them. <br>
There are a few legitimate options for those who wish to run homebrew
software- such as the Datel Games 'N' Music cartridge, which I develop
on.<br>
  Unfortunately, these carts reportedly do not function on the DSi. <span class="font_color2_11">Nintendo has locked out legitimate homebrew! </span><br>
  <br>
The only options left are unauthorized carts, often used primarily for
running commercial software- which justifies Nintendo's crackdown. <br>
  There are many good homebrew software titles available, but few commercial-quality homebrew games- and definitely no <em><strong><span class="font_color2_11">KILLER APP</span></strong></em>. <br>
  "bob's game" may possibly become the first <strong><em>significant legitimate reason</em></strong> to own one of these carts!<br>
  <br>
  In these times of severe economic turmoil (especially in Japan) Nintendo <em><strong>needs</strong></em> the DSi to work.<br>
  A company of their size cannot operate for long in such a climate with diving profits!<br>
  <br>
  If "bob's game" is released worldwide as a <em><strong><span class="font_color2_11">KILLER APP</span></strong></em> homebrew title, this could potentially lead to the DSi becoming completely useless as a countermeasure.<br>
  These devices may become even more 
  widespread, available, and abundant than ever before- if the <strong>demand for a legitimate use was high enough</strong>.<br>
  This is simply my own line of reasoning- the reason why<em><strong> I do not want to release "bob's game" as homebrew software!</strong></em><br>
  <strong>I don't want to damage Nintendo!</strong><br>

  <strong><span class="font_color2_11">Nintendo- I am publicly protesting for 100 days on live webcam for a reason!</span></strong><br>
  I need your help to release "bob's game" in a legitimate way!<br>
  <br>
  I'm a core gamer. I've played  thousands of games and spent thousands on games.
  I can name hundreds of titles for nearly any system off of the top of my head.<br>
  I've beaten almost every significant game for every Nintendo platform. <em><strong>I even beat Virtual Boy Wario Land! </strong>(And I'm not blind!)<br>
  </em>I've
played practically every demoscene game released in 10 years. I've
played old-school adventure games, text games, DOS games, Flash games,
Amiga games, you name it.<em><br>
  </em>I've played imports in
Japanese without being able to read them. I'm still patiently "waiting"
for Super Mario 64 2, Mario 128, and Earthbound 64. (Not Mother 3 for
GBA, it's not the same.)<br>
  I've never played Final Fantasy 7 because I'm still waiting for its release on Ultra 64. Yes, I know- it won't.<br>
  <strong class="font_color2_11">I know "bob's game" is great.</strong><br>
  I even know that true fans don't want to be spoiled.
  They want to be surprised.<br>
  I'm not showing it until it's out. It matters. End of story.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I grew up with a  Game Boy, a childhood spent buried in a <em><strong>magical box</strong></em> with ugly green graphics.<br>
  "At last, I am this wizard- this sorcery is mine now." <br>
  It means  a lot to me, more than I can express. I tortured myself for half a decade for it.<br>
  I've made a DS title for this reason, and I'm  trying to port it to other platforms, but it's <em><strong>MADE FOR THE DS</strong></em>.<br>
  <br>
  I'm 25 years old and I have spent the last five years writing a game- not going to seminars or conventions.<br>
  I didn't learn how to make games. <em><strong>I just made one by figuring out how.</strong></em> How do you make games? Step one: make a game.<br>
  Think about it from my side of things- <br>
  I have no "industry connections," and I can't possibly understand how the process is supposed to work<em><strong> because all the information is locked up! </strong></em> <br>
  You've presented me with a form to fill out, with a few specific requirements and no further information.<br>
  I've met your requirements and filled out your form! What else am I supposed to do?<strong><br>
  </strong>How am I supposed to know if you don't<strong> <em>allow</em> <em>anyone to know</em>?</strong><br>
  <strong>All I know is that I'm supposed to receive a decision in 6-8 weeks, and my emails are not being returned!</strong><br>

  "bob's game" has never been intended as "homebrew." I've aimed to make a commercial game from the very start.<br>
  <span class="font_color2_11">I have tried every approach to release "bob's game" through official means- because <strong>it was never intended as a "homebrew" game.</strong></span><br>
  Yet "bob's game," a highly-anticipated, highly-publicized, retail-length, retail-quality, 20-hour-long, <strong>512 megabit</strong> adventure title- is being treated as such.<br>

  Releasing a retail length, retail quality game as "homebrew" indeed makes "bob's game" a <em><strong><span class="font_color2_11">KILLER APP</span></strong></em> for "homebrew-enabling" devices.<br>
  <strong>I do not want to support these devices</strong>, because many of them are able to run commercial software. This is damaging to developers <em>like myself.</em><br>
  <br>
  This puts me in a major predicament. Do I simply give up on five years of tireless effort? I cannot!<br>
  I am attempting to inform Nintendo what could happen if this project is released in the only way they have left me.<br>
  <span class="font_color2_11">I am begging them- publicly, on live broadcast, for 100 days- I do not want to release "bob's game" as "homebrew."</span><br>

  <br>
  How can I say this to make them understand? <br>

  2008-12-31 (<strong><span class="font_color1_11">Stage 20</span></strong> - <strong>The KILLER APP</strong>)<br>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  I am publicly begging a <strong><em>Japanese company</em></strong> with  a <strong><em>Japanese style protest</em></strong> to sell me what I require (and meet requirements for)<br>
  to 
  legitimately publish 
  my game 
  in a way that costs them nothing, puts them at no risk, and makes them licensing money.<br>
  <br>
  As I've said from the very beginning,<br>
  <strong class="font_11">My goal is to release a cartridge form of "bob's game" for the DS and DSi platforms.</strong><br>
  <br>
  If I cannot legitimately publish my game, the only option left to fulfill this goal  is to release a <em class="font_color2_11"><strong>KILLER APP</strong></em> for a DS "homebrew device."<br>
  There has never been a true <em class="font_color2_11"><strong>KILLER APP</strong></em> released for this kind of device, especially as a <em><strong>launch title for a brand new console</strong></em><strong>. </strong><br>
  "bob's game" is being translated into many languages, <em>including Japanese</em>, and will be released worldwide. <span class="font_color1_11"><br>
  <strong class="font_color2_11">Unfortunately, this has the potential to significantly cut into Nintendo's bottom line.</strong></span> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>I like Nintendo.</strong><br>
  The last thing I want to do is release my game in a way that might damage them.<br>
  Why do you think I spent<em> <strong>five years</strong></em> making a   "Nintendo game?"<br>
  <strong>I am going to see this</strong> project through to the end, and they are leaving me with no choice.<br>
  I've tried everything, and it's gotten me nowhere. I have done nothing wrong.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="font_11">News of my protest has now reached several major Japanese gaming sites. </strong><br>
  This means that Nintendo of Japan is becoming aware of what its Western branch has done-<br>
  and they are beginning to receive a great deal of negative PR on their <em><strong>home front.</strong></em><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  In other words- because of what may be the decision of a <strong><em>single NOA executive</em></strong>-<br>
  <span class="font_color1_11"><strong class="font_color2_11">Nintendo of Japan may now be at risk of some very serious consequences.</strong></span><br>

  <img src="BobsGame_files/green.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"><br>
  <br>
  On <span class="font_color2_11">November 17th of 2007</span>, well <strong>over</strong> a <strong>YEAR</strong> ago, I contacted <span class="font_color2_11">Mr. Tom Prata</span>, 
  Senior Director of Project Development at Nintendo of America.<br>
I explained to him that I had worked for several years on a console
game for DS, and that I wanted to purchase the NITRO SDK in order to
finish the title.<br>
  Mr. Prata responded, and we emailed back and forth about 50 times discussing the title and the NITRO requirements.<br>
  After doing a background check in December, we teleconferenced to discuss the game. He wanted to see it.<br>
  This culminated in a meeting, scheduled for February 22, 2008, at the Game Developers Conference.<br>
  <br>
  At the meeting, Mr. Prata barely even bothered to look at the game he had stalled me for months to see.<br>
He advised me to apply for a developer license, and assured me that he
would do what he could to make sure my application was fast-tracked.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Why</em></strong> is my application being mysteriously stalled, Mr. Prata?<br>

<p class="font_11"> I cannot finish "bob's game" for Nintendo DS until I have the Nitro SDK!<br>
  I am supposed to receive a decision in 6-8 weeks. <em>It has been 16 weeks!</em><br>
  <br>
  I don't really know what else to do!<br>
  I'm beginning to think someone at Nintendo is <em><strong>insanely jealous</strong></em> they didn't think of it 
  first and <br>
  wants to keep me from releasing "bob's game!" I've got my eye on that "Reggie" guy, he's suspicious for sure! <br>
  I heard he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUTl1vEG62Q">beats people up and writes down their names or something</a>.. I'm onto you, Reggie! ;}<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="font_14_bold">The Rules:</strong></p>
<p class="font_11">I cannot leave this <em><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=viridian+room">viridian room</a></em>. The door is locked <em>and barricaded</em> from the outside<em>.</em><br>
  I am sleeping behind the camera, and yes- I've got a shower.
  Food is delivered once a week by a friend.<br>
  I have no internet access, television, or game consoles besides those I am developing on.<br>
  I can receive and send email on my Android G1, so I can get Nintendo's reply and update my site with tether.<br>
  The LED counter will be incremented once a day, and sometimes it will display <em>hints and secret messages</em>.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="font_color2_36"><strong><em>This is my 100 day protest to Nintendo!</em></strong></span><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="font_14"><em>All I need is for them to allow me to <strong>purchase a DVD</strong> with the software I need to finish!</em></span><span class="font_14"><em><br>
</em></span></p>
<p class="font_11"><span class="font_color1_11">I met with Nintendo in February- <strong>almost  a YEAR ago</strong>- to ask to purchase the SDK.</span><br>
  I did teleconferencing. I flew to GDC and had a face-to-face meeting.<br>
  I asked the WarioWorld division, and they sent me to marketing.<br>
  I talked to marketing, and they said apply with WarioWorld division!<br>
  The agreement on the application states I will receive a decision in 6-8 weeks. It has been <strong class="font_color1_11">16</strong> weeks!<br>
  I fulfill all the requirements- I'm a financially stable registered company with a FEIN working from a commercial address.<br>
  When Nintendo decides to approve my developer license application I will end my protest.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I worked on this project for <span class="font_14_bold"><strong><em>five years</em></strong></span> because I wanted to make a "Nintendo game."<br>
  I'm not about to give up just because some stubborn  intern or mid-level marketing exec at NOA is deleting my emails!<br>
  <strong class="font_color1_11">I want an answer, and I want to hear it from the top.</strong> <br>
  Will the<em>men of talent </em>at Nintendo- those with passion and ideas of their own- dismiss mine?<br>
  <strong><br>
  <em>I REALLY  WANT TO FINISH THIS GAME!</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  <span class="font_blue"><br>
  </span><span class="font_color2_182">I need your help! Please <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/webform.jsp">let Nintendo know</a> if you would like to play "bob's game!"</span><span class="font_color2_11"><br>
  <br>
  </span><br>
I don't need a publisher, that's not the issue. I must become a
licensed developer to have a licensed game with licensed tools.<br>
I'm not asking Nintendo to publish my game- they aren't a publisher for
third party titles. Many publishers are interested in "bob's game."<br>
  All I'm asking from them is that they allow me to <em>purchase a DVD</em> with the software I need to get my game into retail shrinkwrap.<br>
  <br>
  There is no cost to them whatsoever- in fact, they would be <em>profiting</em> from the  SDK costs, and from every retail cartridge sold! <br>
  I'm a bit frustrated with the process- Why is my development studio (<em>Robert Pelloni LC</em>) with a full, complete, polished, high-quality <br>
  title
  being treated any differently than the hundreds of studios putting out "<em>Fluffy Bunny's  Movie Franchise Platformer 16</em>?"<br>
  <br>
The issue is something else entirely. Someone at Nintendo doesn't like
this project, because it blurs the line between homebrew and commercial.<br>
  In the past, if you wanted to make games you got a job for EA- and worked on drawing a part of a shoe. <br>
  I wanted to make the whole thing, so I did. What's wrong with that?<br>
  <br>
  Nobody has ever single-handedly created a retail length RPG type console game this size. How do I know that? They<em> told me!</em><br>
  It's a special case- <em>an industry first-</em> and it's going to take someone in the compa<strong>n</strong>y taking extra initiative and making a move.<br>
  In other words, they're going to need some convincing. Can I fly there and negotiate? I asked that already. They don't know.<br>
  <br>
  There have been petitions from fans towards Nintendo in the past that have fallen on deaf ears, such as the Mother 3 campaign.<br>
The only tools I have on my side are dedication and determination. I
had to do something different. How can I show Nintendo I'm serious?<br>
  <em class="font_11">A nonviolent passive sit-down protest to a <strong>Japanese company</strong></em>- live on webcam 24/7, by a high-profile independent developer. <br>
  <br>
  I plan on staying in here <em><span class="font_14"> 100 days </span></em>or more, so we'll see where it goes. The lease on my office might have to be extended. <br>
  Solitary confinement isn't exactly pleasant. I'm working 16 hour days with no human contact. <br>
  If I'm not mad yet,<em><strong> I will be! </strong></em> Of course, that'll only make the sequel better.. ;}<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, I'm working on the <strong class="font_color2_11">Android</strong>, <strong class="font_color2_11">iPhone</strong>, and <span class="font_color2_11"><strong>OpenPandora</strong></span> ports for 100 days straight.<br>
  These platforms are awesome! Yuu doesn't even <em>need</em> a publisher! What a great idea!<br>
  I'm also looking into XBLA and Steam, thanks to everyone who suggested it!<br>
  <span class="font_color2_11"><br>
  </span><span class="font_color1_11">My
site gets several thousand viewers a day, including many prominent
gaming news outlets, magazines, blogs, and even Nintendo employees. </span><br>
They're definitely aware of what I'm doing, and they're probably hoping
that it'll blow over or that I'll give up. I won't, of course.<br>
  The longer this goes on, the more interesting it becomes.<br>
  <strong class="font_color1_11">I'm not wrong, and it will work.</strong><br>
  <br>
  I'll see you there on day 100, <em><strong>REGGIE!</strong></em><br>
