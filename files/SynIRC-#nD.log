Jun 11 19:31:35 <ShadyGuy>	Hallo
Jun 11 19:33:58 <lolomomo5>	hi
Jun 11 19:34:14 <ShadyGuy>	This room was disappointingly quiet until you showed up
Jun 11 19:37:04 <lolomomo5>	yeah it is pretty quiet
Jun 11 19:37:13 <ShadyGuy>	Yeah
Jun 11 19:37:20 <ShadyGuy>	Im hoping this thing exists C:
Jun 11 19:38:48 <lolomomo5>	me too
Jun 11 19:39:16 <lolomomo5>	I've been waiting for bobs game to come out and this may be it
Jun 11 19:39:47 <ShadyGuy>	Im hoping more information about developing for it starts coming out
Jun 11 19:40:26 <lolomomo5>	I can't wait for the prototype video that's supposed to come out soon
Jun 11 19:40:51 <ShadyGuy>	Once a physical device is actually made then I'll really get excited
Jun 11 19:41:30 <lolomomo5>	me too
Jun 11 19:41:50 <lolomomo5>	I'm glad to finally see a possible release date for bob's game
Jun 11 19:43:22 <ShadyGuy>	I have a game I'd like to port to it
Jun 11 19:43:31 <lolomomo5>	cool
Jun 11 19:43:32 <ShadyGuy>	I designed it originally for PC and I'm releasing it for Mac aswell soon
Jun 11 19:43:39 <ShadyGuy>	http://magnetball.alpium-entertainment.com/
Jun 11 19:44:13 <lolomomo5>	looks fun i'll try it
Jun 11 19:44:38 <ShadyGuy>	Thanks C:
Jun 11 19:45:00 <ShadyGuy>	It's been received pretty well by everyone who's played it
Jun 11 19:45:12 <ShadyGuy>	Except for fools who cant read tutorial text -.-
Jun 11 19:46:06 <lolomomo5>	lol
Jun 11 19:46:49 <lolomomo5>	I've never coded anything but I might give it a try 
Jun 11 19:47:04 <ShadyGuy>	If you have 0 experience, I'd recommend starting out with GameMaker
Jun 11 19:47:14 <ShadyGuy>	http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/
Jun 11 19:47:16 <lolomomo5>	ok
Jun 11 19:47:39 <ShadyGuy>	It has a very loose syntax compared to others
Jun 11 19:47:42 <ShadyGuy>	And a very simple IDE
Jun 11 19:54:20 <lolomomo5>	cool game
Jun 11 19:56:07 <ShadyGuy>	Thanks
Jun 11 19:56:25 <ShadyGuy>	I'm hoping the nD gets a touch screen, but if not I'll have to make each magnet have a button
Jun 11 19:56:32 <ShadyGuy>	And tone down the puzzles
Jun 11 19:56:49 <ShadyGuy>	Because 1 its a kids toy basically, and 2 buttons would probably muddle reactions
Jun 11 19:57:00 <lolomomo5>	yeah
Jun 11 19:57:28 <ShadyGuy>	Probably either free games or a buck a game he'll do for his appstore
Jun 11 19:57:41 <ShadyGuy>	I wouldnt charge unless thats what basically everyone else does
Jun 11 19:57:44 <ShadyGuy>	And maybe not even then
Jun 11 19:57:51 <ShadyGuy>	Dont care much about the cash
Jun 11 20:04:23 <lolomomo5>	well Istarted downloading game maker
Jun 11 20:07:39 <ShadyGuy>	If you need help feel free to ask
Jun 11 20:07:43 <ShadyGuy>	Tutorials on yoyogames too
Jun 11 20:07:49 <lolomomo5>	ok

Jun 11 22:44:12 <Cyahnidde>	well
Jun 11 22:44:20 <Cyahnidde>	it would obviously cost more money
Jun 11 22:44:28 <Cyahnidde>	im not sure what it would look like
Jun 11 22:44:37 <Cyahnidde>	mmmm
Jun 11 22:45:38 <sb057>	I'm guessing that it's going to look a lot like the sp
Jun 11 22:46:02 <sb057>	But it might just be a cover-like clamshell
Jun 11 22:46:12 <Cyahnidde>	I was thinking a cover-like
Jun 11 22:46:29 <Cyahnidde>	it would be nice
Jun 11 22:46:33 <Cyahnidde>	to have a screen on top
Jun 11 22:46:36 <Cyahnidde>	and buttons on bottom
Jun 11 22:46:40 <Cyahnidde>	but probably not
Jun 11 22:46:44 <Cyahnidde>	it may just be a cover
Jun 11 22:46:48 <Cyahnidde>	who knows

Jun 18 18:49:29 <Cola>	Well, I don't really hack anymore because code confuses me and I accidentally updated to 4.3u
Jun 18 18:49:48 <Treeki>	what kind of code were you working with?

Jun 18 18:50:54 ---	ChanServ gives channel operator status to gBev
Jun 18 18:52:01 <Cola>	I don't actually know. I guess I tried to update Dopshop at one point, but no dice. It doesn't matter now, anyway.
Jun 18 18:52:44 <Cola>	We have the nD.
Jun 18 18:54:31 <Kutagh>	Not yet, Cola :p
Jun 18 18:54:50 <Kutagh>	first time++ till end of 2011 before we have the nD :p
Jun 18 18:55:44 <Exophase>	To me the interesting question isn't whether nD will be out or not, but whether or not it'll have enough appeal to get people to develop much for it.
Jun 18 18:56:06 <Cola>	It has enough appeal to get me to develop.
Jun 18 18:56:17 <Cola>	And at least 5 or 10ish other people
Jun 18 18:56:20 <Kutagh>	and as I said on the forums, the popularity of the nD will depend on the quality of the launch line-up.
Jun 18 18:56:26 <Cola>	Indeed
Jun 18 18:56:31 <Exophase>	Cola; What's your experience as a developer?
Jun 18 18:56:42 <Kutagh>	And if it supports C# properly and is not too slow, I'll definitely do a game
Jun 18 18:56:46 <Cola>	Nothing, really.
Jun 18 18:56:50 <Kutagh>	Likely a free game but its a game! :p
Jun 18 18:56:56 <Cola>	I'm more of the artsy, ideas type
Jun 18 18:57:08 <Exophase>	I don't yet know of anyone publically saying that both have established experience and are doing exclusives for the platform.
Jun 18 18:57:11 <Exophase>	That's a tough sale anyway.
Jun 18 18:57:12 <Kutagh>	my experience as dev, no real experience yet but I do have C# experience (around a year of C# at university)
Jun 18 18:57:14 <Exophase>	To convince anyone to.
Jun 18 18:57:50 <Cola>	I've also dabbled in LBP and LBP2
Jun 18 18:57:58 <Kutagh>	Games in C# that I release might be temporary nD exclusives (for a month) perhaps...
Jun 18 18:58:12 <Exophase>	I wouldn't put a lot of faith in C# running on nD
Jun 18 18:58:19 <Kutagh>	me neither
Jun 18 18:58:28 <Cola>	I want someone to make a MLP game, though. That'd be great.
Jun 18 18:58:28 <Kutagh>	that is why I am asking for explicit confirmation :p
Jun 18 18:58:45 <Kutagh>	might need a custom library though that is way downsized to the necessary stuff
Jun 18 18:58:47 <Exophase>	What do you expect though Kutagh, how can they work that out so far in advance of the thing really existing?
Jun 18 18:59:07 <Kutagh>	Exophase, I'm not demanding confirmation right now.
Jun 18 18:59:19 <Kutagh>	I'm basically not developing for nD until good C# support is confirmed
Jun 18 18:59:32 <Exophase>	Okay, maybe I misinterpreted what you meant by "asking for"
Jun 18 18:59:35 <Exophase>	Maybe you were saying "am waiting for"
Jun 18 18:59:49 <Kutagh>	Well, I did place a question about that.
Jun 18 19:00:17 <Exophase>	Take my advice, take any answer Bob gives you about this with a grain of salt ;p
Jun 18 19:00:36 <Kutagh>	heh
Jun 18 19:01:07 <Kutagh>	If they simply say 'no plans for that' then I know to move on somewhere else for development. Learning C++ is not really what I'm planning atm
Jun 18 19:01:21 <Kutagh>	Especially since it would only be for the nD in the near future
Jun 18 19:01:42 <Exophase>	Personally, I think you'd have to be kind of crazy to develop for nD exclusively, and Bob says he doesn't expect exclusives anyway.
Jun 18 19:02:24 <Kutagh>	Month exclusivity to promote the nD, I wouldn't mind.
Jun 18 19:02:33 <Exophase>	It's true that right now there aren't many choices for gaming controls + "open" app store (I use quotes because nD's doesn't even sound that open)
Jun 18 19:03:14 <Kutagh>	Also reserved about that.
Jun 18 19:03:25 <Exophase>	That could change though.
Jun 18 19:03:44 <Exophase>	Actually it really already is with platforms like Xperia Play
Jun 18 19:03:50 <Exophase>	And other Android platforms with gaming controls..
Jun 18 19:04:05 <Exophase>	Then that just leaves price.
Jun 18 19:04:36 <Exophase>	Personally I think you get too cheap while being in the same class of device and people won't take you seriously.. and will focus on the negatives.
Jun 18 19:05:05 <Kutagh>	heh
Jun 18 19:07:05 <Exophase>	http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=121
Jun 18 19:07:13 <Exophase>	Heh.. I'm surprised people are distributing the music from Bob's Game..
Jun 18 19:08:00 <Kutagh>	I might be a dev, I still pirate games (but I also buy games :p)
Jun 18 19:09:37 <Cola>	@ Kutagh Same
Jun 18 19:09:56 <Cola>	Also, I'm pretty sure I'm reading Homestuck
Jun 18 19:10:55 <Kutagh>	too many companies that have a good track record that then released a shitty game...
Jun 18 19:10:58 <Kutagh>	<.<

Jul 04 22:01:56 -->	You are now talking on #nD
Jul 04 22:01:56 ---	Topic for #nD is the-nD.com chatroom
Jul 04 22:01:56 ---	Topic for #nD set by gBev at Fri Jun 10 15:14:04 2011

Jul 04 22:02:00 <Exophase>	So I'm hoping we can find a decent price on 512MB of LPDDR2, but if we can't it'll be DDR3.. and probably not PoP
Jul 04 22:02:40 <Exophase>	If i.MX538 is anything like OMAP3530 it should have two external memory interfaces going off chip, one in addition to the PoP.. we should only need one..
Jul 04 22:02:54 <Exophase>	So it should still be okay to use it with non-PoP.. would be preferable about i.MX535 which is a lot larger.
Jul 04 22:03:22 <Exophase>	But it looks like the most cost effective DDR3 solution is 4x 128MB 8bit chips :/
Jul 04 22:03:24 <Exophase>	So lots of board space..
Jul 04 22:03:48 <ps2chiper>	Manufacturing is not as easy as you think, like our factory can only go down to 0.8mm ball pitch
Jul 04 22:03:51 <Exophase>	The funny thing about the DDR3 prices I see is that it costs less to get 800MHz than 400MHz, 533MHz, or 667MHz
Jul 04 22:04:13 <Exophase>	Yes, that's why I don't really expect it to be assembled in China, but I guess we'll see?
Jul 04 22:04:45 <ps2chiper>	where do you expect it would be assembled?
Jul 04 22:05:14 <Exophase>	I don't know, but CircuitCo for instance, who does BeagleBoard and Pandora, is in Texas
Jul 04 22:05:28 <ps2chiper>	Did you have any smt in mind? I see
Jul 04 22:05:39 -->	Timic (~chatzilla@synIRC-EEFBB57E.meb801.vic.optusnet.com.au) has joined #nD
Jul 04 22:05:51 <ps2chiper>	I should email them for a quote
Jul 04 22:06:04 <Exophase>	The thing to watch out for them is they have been doing Pandora REALLY slowly.
Jul 04 22:06:07 <Exophase>	Pandora boards I mean
Jul 04 22:06:20 <Exophase>	So if you go with them it might be wise to only do it for the first 500, then look for someplace else with a bigger order.
Jul 04 22:06:34 <Exophase>	Then again I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad idea to just go with the bigger package parts and stick with a Chinese house
Jul 04 22:06:48 <Exophase>	This is with a 5" screen and has less components than Pandora, no keyboard, I'm sure there's room.
Jul 04 22:06:53 <Exophase>	It's not a tiny phone or anything.
Jul 04 22:07:06 <Exophase>	The i.MX53 quick start board is 3" by 3", so..
Jul 04 22:07:22 <Exophase>	(that fits i.MX535 and 4x DDR3)
Jul 04 22:07:53 <ps2chiper>	did you calculate the size using mobile ddr3?
Jul 04 22:08:12 <Exophase>	Mobile DDR3 doesn't exist yet.
Jul 04 22:08:21 <Exophase>	LPDDR2 is pretty new.
Jul 04 22:08:31 <Exophase>	That would be our first choice, but I'm worried the cost is more..
Jul 04 22:08:43 <Exophase>	DDR3 should at least be lower power than DDR2
Jul 04 22:08:52 <ps2chiper>	Im sure it would be cheaper that PoP
Jul 04 22:09:14 <Exophase>	Yeah, I dunno. For PoP we'd want an Elpida chip I think.
Jul 04 22:09:33 <ps2chiper>	do you have a link to that one
Jul 04 22:09:41 <Exophase>	The only options I know of are Elpida, Micron, and Samsung.. and Samsung's LPDDR2 PoPs in decent density aren't out yet..
Jul 04 22:09:51 <Exophase>	I can give you a link to the datasheet for the one PandaBoard uses if you're interested.
Jul 04 22:10:10 <Exophase>	I looked for a part number that'd fit us (512MB LPDDR2 one) and I did find it on a spreadsheet for something from a Japanese site..
Jul 04 22:10:27 <Exophase>	PandaBoard uses a 1GB part, 32-bit with 2-channel
Jul 04 22:10:51 <Exophase>	You can get a 512MB LPDDR2 PoP from Micron on reseller sites but it costs $50 :/
Jul 04 22:11:03 <Exophase>	While 4x 128MB DDR3 from Micron costs under $28
Jul 04 22:11:14 <ps2chiper>	http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/25/samsung-starts-baking-30nm-4gb-lpddr2-chips-packaging-2gb-mobil/
Jul 04 22:11:15 <Exophase>	And DDR3 is probably lower latency, although obviously higher power..
Jul 04 22:11:30 <Exophase>	Yeah, do you think we should make something like that a later goal?
Jul 04 22:12:01 <Exophase>	PoP theoretically means lower latency too, but in practice I don't know if that works out to be true, the latency on OMAP3 is terrible.
Jul 04 22:12:08 <ps2chiper>	I dont think ddr2 or ddr3 will make a difference on a imx535
Jul 04 22:12:25 <Exophase>	LPDDR2 vs DDR3.
Jul 04 22:12:29 <Exophase>	It'll make a difference in power consumption.
Jul 04 22:13:00 <ps2chiper>	mobile ram and sticking to non pop design would probably be the best idea
Jul 04 22:13:01 <Exophase>	Plain DDR2 isn't a consideration, and LPDDR is too slow and not low power enough.
Jul 04 22:13:15 <Exophase>	The DDR3 would be twice the bandwidth..
Jul 04 22:13:36 <Exophase>	And when at peak may be lower power. MDDR/LPDDR will have more power saving features though.
Jul 04 22:13:37 <ps2chiper>	what does the freescale board ship with?
Jul 04 22:13:44 <Exophase>	DDR3
Jul 04 22:13:48 <Exophase>	4x
Jul 04 22:13:54 <Exophase>	Micron chips.
Jul 04 22:14:08 <Exophase>	The ones they use seem to cost nearly $30 each everywhere I looked though. Obviously they didn't pay anything close to that.
Jul 04 22:14:56 <Exophase>	Freescale recommends using at least 533MHz RAM, although I don't know why.
Jul 04 22:15:03 <Exophase>	Like I said, 800MHz is even cheaper for some reason.
Jul 04 22:15:20 <Exophase>	So at least that won't be an overclocking bottleneck.. although probably on i.MX53 the memory clock is asynchronous to the CPU clock..
Jul 04 22:15:56 <Exophase>	Whoever makes PC DIMMs are obtaining these chips for way less too..
Jul 04 22:16:20 <ps2chiper>	i keep saying memory is a game
Jul 04 22:16:54 <Exophase>	Okay, what else?
Jul 04 22:16:58 <ps2chiper>	you only have 4 countries that make memory, china, taiwan, korea, japan
Jul 04 22:17:08 <ps2chiper>	and the quality is in that order too
Jul 04 22:17:15 <Exophase>	China makes the best memory??
Jul 04 22:17:22 <ps2chiper>	japan does
Jul 04 22:17:34 -->	emusan (Mibbit@synIRC-3BCFEBF3.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) has joined #nD
Jul 04 22:17:34 <ps2chiper>	china being the lowest quality
Jul 04 22:17:41 <emusan>	wewt china
Jul 04 22:17:49 <emusan>	did I enter in on something?
Jul 04 22:17:56 <emusan>	also, hi
Jul 04 22:18:07 <Exophase>	BTW, Micron is an American company.
Jul 04 22:18:19 <Exophase>	And a very large memory manufacturer, especially since they bought Numonyx.
Jul 04 22:18:57 <Exophase>	emusan; Just more talking about components
Jul 04 22:19:00 <Exophase>	RAM in particular.
Jul 04 22:19:27 <ps2chiper>	where are their fabs located?
Jul 04 22:19:28 <emusan>	ah
Jul 04 22:19:30 <emusan>	any luck yet?
Jul 04 22:20:01 <Exophase>	Googling it
Jul 04 22:20:12 <Exophase>	They joint own some fabs with Intel.
Jul 04 22:20:17 <Exophase>	But that's for flash.
Jul 04 22:20:29 <Exophase>	That fab is in Utah
Jul 04 22:20:38 <ps2chiper>	ok
Jul 04 22:20:39 <Exophase>	Micron has its own fabs too
Jul 04 22:20:41 <ps2chiper>	beb
Jul 04 22:20:55 <Exophase>	Finding location
Jul 04 22:21:22 <Exophase>	Fab 1 is in Boise I think.
Jul 04 22:25:26 <Exophase>	I think the other one is in Taiwan.. hard to find info on this >_>
Jul 04 22:27:08 <Exophase>	They have a fab in Manassas Virgina, that's their flagship 300mm wafer site
Jul 04 22:28:08 <Exophase>	Anyway according to this SemiAccurate article Micron is the last US DRAM manufacturer..
Jul 04 22:29:14 <Exophase>	What are the main Chinese DRAM manufacturers? Powerchip?
Jul 04 22:29:31 <Exophase>	Elpida, Toshiba, and Hynix are Japanese..
Jul 04 22:32:02 <Exophase>	Samsung is Korean.. I thought there was another
Jul 04 22:32:37 <Exophase>	Hm, Hynix has PoPs.
Jul 04 22:32:49 <Exophase>	.. okay, maybe it's just working on it.
Jul 04 22:33:55 <Exophase>	Their LPDDR2 is only in sampling.
Jul 04 22:34:08 <Exophase>	But is PoP
Jul 04 22:34:13 <Exophase>	But only 256MB :/
Jul 04 22:35:20 <Exophase>	Oh, huh, they have low power DDR3s, at 1.35V
Jul 04 22:41:26 <ps2chiper>	im back
Jul 04 22:41:55 <ps2chiper>	so their virgina site is for wafers only and then the assemble is in taiwan
Jul 04 22:42:21 <Exophase>	How did you determine that?
Jul 04 22:42:32 <Exophase>	Why would they need to ship ICs to China to be packaged?
Jul 04 22:42:41 <Exophase>	Er Taiwan
Jul 04 22:42:55 <Exophase>	I don't think Fab 6 is their only American fab either
Jul 04 22:42:56 <ps2chiper>	because i would imagine their largest customer is china
Jul 04 22:43:41 <Exophase>	I don't know if that's true or not.. obviously some domestic entities will prefer to buy American, like the government
Jul 04 22:43:55 <Exophase>	But whether or not it is, I don't see why it'd be cheaper to ship to Taiwan and package there than package here then ship to wherever.
Jul 04 22:44:08 <Exophase>	Especially if they do validation post-packaging.
Jul 04 22:44:15 <Exophase>	Which I imagine they usually have to.
Jul 04 22:45:08 <Exophase>	They also probably sell bare dies to some clients.
Jul 04 22:45:17 <Exophase>	I know Elpida does.
Jul 04 22:46:23 <emusan>	oh, Happy 4th of July!
Jul 04 22:47:01 <Exophase>	Huh, ISSI is American.. dunno anything about fabs for them.. never even heard of them until now, but they do have parts on Digikey
Jul 04 22:47:10 <Exophase>	They have Chinese offices though.
Jul 04 22:47:24 <Exophase>	And Taiwanese.. and Japanese.. and others.. huh they must be pretty large..
Jul 04 22:47:57 <ps2chiper>	ISSI they are common
Jul 04 22:49:03 <Exophase>	Are they cheap?
Jul 04 22:49:17 <Exophase>	They don't have LPDDR2 or DDR3, just MDDR and DDR2
Jul 04 22:49:43 <Exophase>	Their 2gbit DDR2 chip in production only goes to 333MHz I think
Jul 04 22:49:54 <ps2chiper>	I dont know off the top of my head. I mainly seen them on just sdram products
Jul 04 22:50:00 <Exophase>	Although their datasheet lists 400MHz
Jul 04 22:50:45 <Exophase>	This datasheet is from June 2011 e_e
Jul 04 22:51:17 <ps2chiper>	they mainly sell to the the factories that use sdram,
Jul 04 22:51:25 <ps2chiper>	i seen them some times on routers
Jul 04 22:51:33 <ps2chiper>	also their is winbond
Jul 04 22:51:43 <Exophase>	Yeah I looked at Winbond.
Jul 04 22:51:45 <Exophase>	Didn't have a very good selection.
Jul 04 22:51:56 <ps2chiper>	they sell more than ram
Jul 04 22:52:06 <ps2chiper>	they are actually pretty large in china
Jul 04 22:52:19 <ps2chiper>	i think someone else called electron 
Jul 04 22:52:29 <ps2chiper>	one of my routers uses them
Jul 04 22:52:32 <Exophase>	There's Qimonda.. looks too low density..
Jul 04 22:52:41 <Exophase>	Yeah I think I saw Winbond EEPROM in motherboards.
Jul 04 22:52:43 <Exophase>	Years ago.
Jul 04 22:55:17 <ps2chiper>	its etrontech
Jul 04 22:57:34 <Exophase>	Looks like they've only got low density and pretty slow MDDR/LPDDR
Jul 04 22:57:43 <Exophase>	DDR2 even lower density.
Jul 04 22:58:12 <Exophase>	Wait no, there's a 1gbit one.. it's for use in "hdd applications".. eh
Jul 04 22:59:22 <ps2chiper>	EM68C16CWVB
Jul 04 23:01:20 <ps2chiper>	http://detail.china.alibaba.com/buyer/offerdetail/858628486.html
Jul 04 23:01:20 <Exophase>	Yes that one.
Jul 04 23:01:47 <Exophase>	We'd need two chip selects for that to get 512MB, I have to see how many i.MX53 has for SDRAM
Jul 04 23:01:54 <ps2chiper>	15 rmb each
Jul 04 23:02:18 <Exophase>	Geez.
Jul 04 23:02:22 <Exophase>	So cheap..
Jul 04 23:02:27 <Exophase>	But DDR2 is really not ideal.. still, I dunno.
Jul 04 23:02:31 <ps2chiper>	thats a normal price
Jul 04 23:02:42 <ps2chiper>	its only 400mhz
Jul 04 23:02:48 <Exophase>	That's all we need, probably.
Jul 04 23:02:58 <Exophase>	Even if Freescale recommends 533MHz, I don't see why..
Jul 04 23:03:21 <Exophase>	What does this say the size is?
Jul 04 23:03:22 <ps2chiper>	sorry, wrong send
Jul 04 23:03:37 <ps2chiper>	i mean hdd is high density data
Jul 04 23:03:44 <Exophase>	Oh ;p
Jul 04 23:03:49 <Exophase>	Haha
Jul 04 23:03:49 <Exophase>	Okay.
Jul 04 23:03:57 <Exophase>	I was thrown off because it said for "speciality applications"
Jul 04 23:04:15 <ps2chiper>	it means non pc application
Jul 04 23:04:18 <Exophase>	Anyway four of these would definitely keep prices down, if at a power consumption cost..
Jul 04 23:04:31 <Exophase>	I can't believe it's so cheap..
Jul 04 23:04:40 <ps2chiper>	thats a normal price actually
Jul 04 23:04:54 <ps2chiper>	japanese and korean chips cost more
Jul 04 23:05:02 <ps2chiper>	etrontech is fabbed in taiwan i think
Jul 04 23:05:03 <Exophase>	I wonder what node this is made at
Jul 04 23:05:21 <Exophase>	Anyway I guess this would keep RAM under $10
Jul 04 23:05:26 -->	[]J (~J@Ching.Chong.Chopsticks.China) has joined #nD
Jul 04 23:05:32 <Exophase>	Depending on what exchange rates we get though..
Jul 04 23:05:47 <Triverske>	And back
Jul 04 23:06:03 <Exophase>	Ugh, I can't connect when I searched.
Jul 04 23:06:04 <ps2chiper>	welcome back jaded and the other
Jul 04 23:06:10 <Exophase>	Would still like to see what our options for DDR3 and LPDDR2 are.
Jul 04 23:06:16 <emusan>	lol the other
Jul 04 23:06:37 <Exophase>	Triverske; Right now the cheapest way to get 512MB of RAM is 4x 128MB chips from Etron
Jul 04 23:06:43 <[]J>	;>
Jul 04 23:06:55 <ps2chiper>	Triverske is always quiet 
Jul 04 23:06:57 <Triverske>	What kind of price is that?
Jul 04 23:06:58 <Exophase>	Getting something similar in DDR3 from Micron will cost 3x more, at least looking at prices on Avent/Arrow/whatever
Jul 04 23:07:00 <Exophase>	< $10
Jul 04 23:07:04 <Triverske>	Well hell
Jul 04 23:07:11 <Triverske>	That's nothing
Jul 04 23:07:13 <Exophase>	I know what you're going to ask.
Jul 04 23:07:18 <Exophase>	1GB of that would take a LOT of board space.
Jul 04 23:07:25 <Exophase>	I don't even know if this will work with four of these.
Jul 04 23:07:29 <Triverske>	Ah
Jul 04 23:07:51 <Triverske>	Price is important
Jul 04 23:07:54 <Exophase>	Should probably manage though.
Jul 04 23:08:08 <Exophase>	Compared to Pandora we'd have similar board space, but no big keyboard and second SD slot..
Jul 04 23:08:43 <Exophase>	I'd prefer not to use DDR2 though, since it'll increase power consumption.
Jul 04 23:08:47 <emusan>	is this ram other memory as well? or did you guys abandon that?
Jul 04 23:08:52 <Exophase>	LPDDR2 is preferable, then DDR3, then DDR2.
Jul 04 23:09:10 <emusan>	is this ram going to have other memory...*
Jul 04 23:09:14 <Exophase>	emusan; I don't think that's gonna happen, and if we're using multiple ICs PoP is not going to be on the table as well.. but we don't really need to save that kind of board space.
Jul 04 23:09:27 <Exophase>	We're not even really looking at embedded NAND, just an internal SD
Jul 04 23:09:27 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 04 23:09:31 <emusan>	I thought that might happen...
Jul 04 23:09:42 <emusan>	lol thats what I suggested ;)
Jul 04 23:09:42 <ps2chiper>	so i looked at the one datasheet from etrontech
Jul 04 23:09:54 <ps2chiper>	it says ddr2-800 is 400mhz
Jul 04 23:10:20 <Exophase>	Yeah that's the usual nomenclature
Jul 04 23:10:33 <ps2chiper>	and the speed ns
Jul 04 23:10:34 <ps2chiper>	1.8, 2.5, 3
Jul 04 23:11:01 <ps2chiper>	so i guess 1.8 is faster than ddr2-800
Jul 04 23:11:02 <Exophase>	So it supports up to 533MHz..
Jul 04 23:11:24 <Exophase>	The one you linked on alibaba is the 2.5ns grade right?
Jul 04 23:12:22 <ps2chiper>	it says EM68C16CWVB-25/18H
Jul 04 23:13:02 <ps2chiper>	ic37.com is the place where you really buy parts
Jul 04 23:14:02 <Exophase>	Can you link the datasheet?
Jul 04 23:14:29 <ps2chiper>	no, i read the 512Mb one and started comparing information 
Jul 04 23:15:10 <Exophase>	Guess we should ask for one.
Jul 04 23:15:23 <Triverske>	On the subject of case design, we need to figure that out
Jul 04 23:15:29 <ps2chiper>	I'll send an email
Jul 04 23:15:33 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; Thanks
Jul 04 23:15:39 <Exophase>	Triverske; Yeah well :/
Jul 04 23:16:07 <Exophase>	I think something like the drawing ps2chiper made isn't bad ;p
Jul 04 23:16:15 <Exophase>	Maybe with a little less protusions, but still some
Jul 04 23:16:19 <Triverske>	I didn't see it?
Jul 04 23:16:39 <Exophase>	Getting link
Jul 04 23:16:58 <Exophase>	http://www.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?155255-Dingoo-Handheld-Video-Game-Consoles
Jul 04 23:17:10 <Exophase>	At the bottom of the thread.. I guess maybe less rounded on the bottom side
Jul 04 23:17:28 <Exophase>	The grips give room for second shoulders, I suppose.
Jul 04 23:17:48 <Exophase>	You'll still want to have them on the thin side, thinner than PS2 shoulders..
Jul 04 23:18:44 <Exophase>	Also I wouldn't put the dpad on the bottom.
Jul 04 23:19:03 <Triverske>	Ah
Jul 04 23:19:11 <Exophase>	If this is an emulator machine the dpad will still be used way more than the left analog, so it's not good to deprioritize it.
Jul 04 23:19:26 <Exophase>	And I'd go with a good semi-circular dpad
Jul 04 23:19:37 <Exophase>	I mean, circular with a d part raised out of it, like Pandora's.
Jul 04 23:19:54 <Triverske>	Also, I tested out side by side shoulder buttons, they'll work out
Jul 04 23:19:59 <ps2chiper>	people were hoping for a psx emulator and n64 emulator more than a 2d one
Jul 04 23:20:01 <Exophase>	Tested how?
Jul 04 23:20:07 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; There'd be those too.
Jul 04 23:20:12 <Exophase>	Most PS games were designed for dpad.
Jul 04 23:20:25 <Exophase>	Dual Shock wasn't released until halfway through its life and only one game requires it..
Jul 04 23:20:28 <Exophase>	I never even had one.
Jul 04 23:20:50 <ps2chiper>	their is also analog emulation of the dpad
Jul 04 23:20:59 <Exophase>	That sucks.
Jul 04 23:21:14 <Exophase>	No way would I use analog for games designed for dpad..
Jul 04 23:21:24 <Exophase>	I can just imagine playing something like Battletoads on it, I bet no one could beat that..
Jul 04 23:21:32 <Exophase>	I can't even beat that on a non-NES controller ;p
Jul 04 23:21:36 <emusan>	I used analog for about half of MGS
Jul 04 23:21:42 <Triverske>	I forced myself to play games with the Wii's classic controller
Jul 04 23:21:53 <emusan>	exophase, have you used a genesis dpad?
Jul 04 23:22:00 <Exophase>	emusan; Yeah but it has been many years.
Jul 04 23:22:04 <Exophase>	It's regarded as pretty good right?
Jul 04 23:22:09 <Exophase>	And Saturn's
Jul 04 23:22:17 <Exophase>	Back in the day bad dpads were more the exception than the norm..
Jul 04 23:22:27 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 04 23:22:33 <emusan>	genesis is by far my favorite
Jul 04 23:22:46 <emusan>	only one I can actually play sf2 on lol
Jul 04 23:23:13 <Exophase>	Pandora's is like that.. the dpad part is a little thicker and less raised, and overall it's smaller.. but still similar idea.
Jul 04 23:23:19 <emusan>	are you planning on using mechanical switches for all the buttons?
Jul 04 23:23:35 <emusan>	cause that would be nice...
Jul 04 23:23:53 <Exophase>	Is that really necessary?
Jul 04 23:24:00 <Exophase>	I hear microswitched dpads wear out sooner..
Jul 04 23:24:20 <emusan>	maybe...
Jul 04 23:24:34 <emusan>	I dunno, I just much prefer switches over mushy pads...
Jul 04 23:24:41 <emusan>	but its definatelly not a priority
Jul 04 23:24:46 <Exophase>	What's an example of a pad with switches?
Jul 04 23:24:54 <Exophase>	vs one without
Jul 04 23:24:56 <emusan>	lol I don't really know...
Jul 04 23:25:07 <emusan>	well most these days don't
Jul 04 23:25:08 <Exophase>	Because I don't think any console ones I opened up were switched.
Jul 04 23:25:16 <Exophase>	Like NES, SNES, Genesis, PC-Engine
Jul 04 23:25:18 <emusan>	xbox 360 is the worst...
Jul 04 23:25:28 <Exophase>	XBox 360 has a bad dpad, other than that it's okay.
Jul 04 23:25:28 <emusan>	maybe not dpad...
Jul 04 23:25:33 <emusan>	would be neat to see it though...
Jul 04 23:25:45 <Exophase>	Pandora doesn't have switches (except for the shoulders) and it seems okay.
Jul 04 23:26:23 <Exophase>	Except the shoulders, incidentally ;p
Jul 04 23:26:29 <Exophase>	I think they used switches too small there.
Jul 04 23:26:33 <Exophase>	And not enough support for the buttons.
Jul 04 23:27:18 <emusan>	is that picture in that thread for a different device?
Jul 04 23:27:25 <emusan>	or the one Triverske is talking about?
Jul 04 23:27:52 <Exophase>	It's one ps2chiper was pitching for
Jul 04 23:28:03 <ps2chiper>	what?
Jul 04 23:28:16 <ps2chiper>	sorry paying attention to something else
Jul 04 23:28:18 <Exophase>	Your maxconsole thread
Jul 04 23:28:20 <emusan>	in the maxconsle thread
Jul 04 23:28:44 <ps2chiper>	yeah, that was based on an infotmic soc
Jul 04 23:28:49 <emusan>	exophase mentioned the drawing was how Triverske's should look but in the thread you mention anotherone...
Jul 04 23:29:01 <emusan>	lol how many of these will we have?
Jul 04 23:29:07 <Exophase>	Well I wouldn't say that literally but I think something sort of in that direction.
Jul 04 23:29:40 <emusan>	it is a nice design...
Jul 04 23:29:51 <emusan>	reminds me of the genesis controller look lol
Jul 04 23:30:02 <emusan>	the wing
Jul 04 23:31:02 <ps2chiper>	well you need the bottom edges to go into the palm
Jul 04 23:31:13 <ps2chiper>	that way you get more grip with the larger device
Jul 04 23:31:57 <emusan>	I do think two should buttons on each side would be very nice
Jul 04 23:32:02 <emusan>	esp. for PS1...
Jul 04 23:32:10 <emusan>	I know there's ways around it but none are great
Jul 04 23:34:25 <emusan>	lol the thing on page 2 is pretty neat
Jul 04 23:35:01 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; I agree, just think maybe a little less than it does in your picture.
Jul 04 23:35:11 <Exophase>	People are really size whores these days, they like size over comfort
Jul 04 23:35:18 <emusan>	lol
Jul 04 23:35:21 <emusan>	had to giggle at that
Jul 04 23:35:27 <Exophase>	Of course this is appealing to a niche beyond that, but you can only take it so far.
Jul 04 23:35:35 <Exophase>	They'll want something they can fit in.. at least some sort of pocket ;p
Jul 04 23:35:39 <Exophase>	If not a pants pocket.
Jul 04 23:36:08 <Exophase>	That said, I wonder if towards the bottom of the grip area would be the best place for speakers.
Jul 04 23:36:18 <Exophase>	Since you wouldn't totally cover it with your palm.
Jul 04 23:36:25 <emusan>	how much larger would this be than the psp-1000
Jul 04 23:36:40 <emusan>	I think the face is best for speakers...
Jul 04 23:36:46 <emusan>	that way they point right at you...
Jul 04 23:36:49 <Exophase>	I'm still talking front facing.
Jul 04 23:36:50 <Triverske>	I just made a model
Jul 04 23:36:56 <Triverske>	uploading pics
Jul 04 23:36:56 <emusan>	oh okay...
Jul 04 23:36:58 <emusan>	out of?
Jul 04 23:37:03 <Exophase>	And if it has a 5" screen, analog sticks.. it'll be longer than PSP-1000
Jul 04 23:37:10 <Exophase>	And if it has grips it'll be wider too..
Jul 04 23:37:13 <Exophase>	Not a ton but still a little.
Jul 04 23:37:17 <Exophase>	It won't be an Atari Lynx or anything ;p
Jul 04 23:37:27 <emusan>	cause I could fit the PSP1k into my pants pockets easy
Jul 04 23:37:32 <Triverske>	I think you'll like this exophase
Jul 04 23:37:36 <emusan>	lol my wallet is bigger
Jul 04 23:37:55 <Exophase>	I.. wouldn't like to fit my PSP in my pants pocket
Jul 04 23:38:00 <Exophase>	I'd be worried about sitting down and breaking it.
Jul 04 23:38:06 <Exophase>	Not that I use my PSP ;p
Jul 04 23:38:07 <emusan>	na side ones
Jul 04 23:38:08 <Exophase>	Haven't in years
Jul 04 23:38:12 <Exophase>	Oh okay.
Jul 04 23:38:12 <emusan>	why not?
Jul 04 23:38:17 <emusan>	lol same but wondering...
Jul 04 23:38:38 <Exophase>	I don't really have focus for most games, don't do it a lot.. occasionally play old ones, that's about it :/
Jul 04 23:38:45 <Exophase>	I mean, don't anymore
Jul 04 23:39:03 <emusan>	lol the internet is giving everyone add
Jul 04 23:39:07 <emusan>	there was some study...
Jul 04 23:39:32 <emusan>	the ability to get information and such instantly screws your patience and all that...
Jul 04 23:39:33 <Exophase>	It's not the internet, I've been using the internet since I was 12
Jul 04 23:39:42 <Exophase>	And most RPGs I played was after that..
Jul 04 23:39:49 <Exophase>	I just have more stress and other stuff occupying my time and thoughts :/
Jul 04 23:40:46 <ps2chiper>	afk
Jul 04 23:40:53 <emusan>	:(
Jul 04 23:41:03 <emusan>	about how old are you?
Jul 04 23:41:20 <Exophase>	27
Jul 04 23:41:23 <emusan>	ah
Jul 04 23:41:29 <emusan>	lol early internet then
Jul 04 23:41:39 <Exophase>	Not that early.
Jul 04 23:41:42 <Triverske>	http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/protok.png/
Jul 04 23:41:48 <emusan>	my first internet use was in 1998 I think..
Jul 04 23:42:05 <emusan>	thats sexy
Jul 04 23:42:05 <Exophase>	Yep, I was 12 in 1996 you know.
Jul 04 23:42:10 <emusan>	oh lol
Jul 04 23:42:12 <emusan>	I was 3
Jul 04 23:42:32 <ps2chiper>	Me?
Jul 04 23:42:57 <emusan>	you?
Jul 04 23:43:11 <Exophase>	Triverske; I like it.
Jul 04 23:43:15 <emusan>	lol I was saying model was sexy
Jul 04 23:43:21 <emusan>	maybe you are too...
Jul 04 23:43:23 <emusan>	I dunno
Jul 04 23:44:14 <Triverske>	I would buy that handheld
Jul 04 23:44:15 <ps2chiper>	looks decent
Jul 04 23:44:33 <ps2chiper>	but that screen is wrong, they dont have them in a high resolution 
Jul 04 23:44:36 <Exophase>	BTW, another alternative to back to back shoulders is putting buttons on the back of the unit.
Jul 04 23:44:41 <Exophase>	I had a controller like that once. It was alright.
Jul 04 23:44:43 <emusan>	whats it modeld in?
Jul 04 23:44:56 <Triverske>	The magic of google sketchup
Jul 04 23:45:01 <emusan>	lo
Jul 04 23:45:02 <emusan>	l
Jul 04 23:45:18 <Exophase>	I've never even heard of it, but that sounds pretty sweet.
Jul 04 23:45:22 <Exophase>	What's wrong with the screen ps2chiper?
Jul 04 23:45:41 <ps2chiper>	well thats 16:9 and they only have 16:10
Jul 04 23:45:49 <Exophase>	I think that's a good location for the speakers too.
Jul 04 23:45:52 <Exophase>	Oh, okay.
Jul 04 23:45:54 <Exophase>	Yeah you have a point ;p
Jul 04 23:46:06 <emusan>	lol I didn't notice
Jul 04 23:46:08 <Exophase>	So I guess make it a little narrower
Jul 04 23:46:13 <Triverske>	me neither :P
Jul 04 23:46:38 <Exophase>	So will a dockable keyboard on the bottom still be a realistic long term goal?
Jul 04 23:46:48 <Triverske>	absolutely
Jul 04 23:47:15 <Exophase>	Triverske, if you can bang this out, I wonder if you can learn to work the CAD tools. Not saying that you have to necessarily come up with enough to deliver for fabrication, but even a high level rough draft could help a lot for recruitment.
Jul 04 23:47:31 <ps2chiper>	then from the beginning you need to design a clipping system for docks
Jul 04 23:47:39 <Exophase>	Yeah..
Jul 04 23:47:46 <Exophase>	And put the connectors in the right places.
Jul 04 23:47:55 <Exophase>	If it's JUST keyboard you can do it fully over USB.
Jul 04 23:47:56 <emusan>	lol the dock can slide into the speaker holes
Jul 04 23:48:03 <Triverske>	lol
Jul 04 23:48:04 <Exophase>	And maybe put a hub in it so it has another USB or two going out.
Jul 04 23:48:22 <Exophase>	Mm, yeah, put some holes in the keyboard to let the speaker go through it :/
Jul 04 23:48:28 <Exophase>	In the latching part I mean..
Jul 04 23:48:48 <emusan>	you prolly wouldn't need to
Jul 04 23:48:56 <emusan>	as long as the speakers point up
Jul 04 23:48:59 <emusan>	towards user
Jul 04 23:49:02 <Triverske>	Hey does anyone know about TRRS?
Jul 04 23:49:08 <Exophase>	I don't.
Jul 04 23:49:10 <Triverske>	and the costs of it?
Jul 04 23:49:10 <emusan>	nope
Jul 04 23:49:19 <ps2chiper>	a link?
Jul 04 23:49:22 <emusan>	what is it spelled out?
Jul 04 23:49:29 <Exophase>	Is it the connector?
Jul 04 23:49:39 <Triverske>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector
Jul 04 23:49:56 <emusan>	someone mentioned it awhile back
Jul 04 23:50:07 <emusan>	for mic and headphones in same connector
Jul 04 23:50:22 <ps2chiper>	i see, yeah those are nothing
Jul 04 23:50:25 <Exophase>	The one that has both stereo out and stereo in right?
Jul 04 23:50:30 <Triverske>	right
Jul 04 23:50:34 <emusan>	I think we should do a USB connector on top and then a dev/expansion port on bottom with another USB or two broken out
Jul 04 23:50:40 <Exophase>	Yeah definitely go for that..
Jul 04 23:51:05 <Exophase>	Whatever we put on the bottom should definitely pass-through/hub on the keyboard though.
Jul 04 23:51:16 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 04 23:51:18 <ps2chiper>	your only problem with that is so few headsets use that connector, you would need to sell a headset to trs adapter too
Jul 04 23:51:36 <emusan>	most normal headsets work in a trs port
Jul 04 23:51:39 <emusan>	at least on my phone
Jul 04 23:51:44 <Exophase>	So don't put too much.. I think it should be USB OTG on top with a micro-B, USB host on bottom through a micro-A
Jul 04 23:51:47 <emusan>	the other connects shut off...
Jul 04 23:51:52 <Exophase>	And USB host under battery with a standard-A
Jul 04 23:51:57 <Exophase>	.. er standard-B >_<
Jul 04 23:52:08 <emusan>	standard-B?
Jul 04 23:52:13 <emusan>	thats bulky
Jul 04 23:52:24 <emusan>	and not that standard...
Jul 04 23:52:33 <Exophase>	Okay am I confusing A and B?
Jul 04 23:52:37 <Exophase>	I mean the rectangular one.
Jul 04 23:52:45 <Exophase>	The longer one.
Jul 04 23:52:47 <Exophase>	Not the more square one.
Jul 04 23:52:51 <emusan>	yeah thats A
Jul 04 23:52:57 <emusan>	http://rocky.digikey.com/weblib/Assmann/Web%20Photos/AU-Y1007.jpg
Jul 04 23:52:59 <emusan>	thats B
Jul 04 23:53:02 <emusan>	they're disgusting
Jul 04 23:53:06 <emusan>	but really strong
Jul 04 23:53:15 <Triverske>	I hate B
Jul 04 23:53:19 <Exophase>	Okay, then A ;p
Jul 04 23:53:20 <emusan>	I do as well
Jul 04 23:53:23 <Exophase>	The really common one.
Jul 04 23:53:28 <emusan>	yar
Jul 04 23:53:29 <Triverske>	Yes
Jul 04 23:53:41 <Exophase>	Standard so that you can put normal dongles in it, possible de-cased
Jul 04 23:53:57 <emusan>	or attach another hub lol
Jul 04 23:54:01 <emusan>	then dongles on that
Jul 04 23:54:32 <Triverske>	HDMI on back?
Jul 04 23:54:38 <emusan>	on top?
Jul 04 23:54:45 <Exophase>	Top.
Jul 04 23:54:45 <emusan>	back would get in way of hands I would think
Jul 04 23:54:51 <Triverske>	that's what I mean
Jul 04 23:54:53 <emusan>	and could be pulled out easier
Jul 04 23:54:54 <emusan>	okay
Jul 04 23:54:55 <Exophase>	One word, don't put any cables on the side goddammit
Jul 04 23:54:57 <Exophase>	Any ports.
Jul 04 23:55:01 <emusan>	yes
Jul 04 23:55:01 <Exophase>	Don't make the mistake GP2X did.
Jul 04 23:55:07 <emusan>	headphone on top as well
Jul 04 23:55:16 <emusan>	soz you don't have to pull through with keyboard
Jul 04 23:55:26 <Exophase>	I always had it plugged into AC because I just devved on it and didn't want to charge batteries all the time.
Jul 04 23:55:36 <Exophase>	But it was a total PITA because the USB cable jutted out the side where I was holding it.
Jul 04 23:55:45 <emusan>	lol Dingoo had headphone on side
Jul 04 23:55:45 <Exophase>	If you put anything on the side at least put it on the top of the side.
Jul 04 23:55:50 <Exophase>	Ugh so stupid
Jul 04 23:55:51 <emusan>	it was not fun
Jul 04 23:56:04 <Exophase>	I know some guy who kept complaining about headphones being on top on GP2X..
Jul 04 23:56:09 <Exophase>	But I never got his problem.
Jul 04 23:56:17 <emusan>	I see no reason why its bad...
Jul 04 23:56:20 <emusan>	just drape cable down back
Jul 04 23:56:22 <Exophase>	Me neither.
Jul 04 23:56:28 <Exophase>	Anyway nothing wrong with putting SD on the side.
Jul 04 23:56:30 <Triverske>	what's a good cheap and fast connection that could be used for a future breakout board?
Jul 04 23:56:41 <Exophase>	Custom.
Jul 04 23:56:44 <emusan>	you mean for a dev port?
Jul 04 23:56:48 <emusan>	just do some headers
Jul 04 23:56:55 <Exophase>	A BoB will carry all sorts of whatever from the SoC
Jul 04 23:57:03 <Exophase>	Won't be any one connection protocol..
Jul 04 23:57:05 <emusan>	BoB?
Jul 04 23:57:09 <Exophase>	breakout board
Jul 04 23:57:17 <Exophase>	And the connector itself won't inhibit speed unless you do something really bad.
Jul 04 23:57:23 <emusan>	lol
Jul 04 23:57:43 <Exophase>	One important thing will be to bring some UARTs off for it.
Jul 04 23:57:48 <Exophase>	Honestly I think you can do without JTAG.
Jul 04 23:57:52 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 04 23:58:00 <emusan>	but make JTAG able to get to from inside case
Jul 04 23:58:15 <Exophase>	Anyway we'll just see what's left over in terms of peripherals, that seem important.
Jul 04 23:58:18 <emusan>	no nead to break it out, but it would be nice to be able to have a backup just in case
Jul 04 23:58:29 <Exophase>	Personally, I haven't had to use JTAG on anything except one device in the past few years.
Jul 04 23:58:48 <ps2chiper>	do a micro jtag
Jul 04 23:59:03 <Exophase>	I think the i.MX535 board has JTAG at least
Jul 04 23:59:05 <ps2chiper>	where its a little ribbon that can connect outside the console
Jul 04 23:59:05 <Exophase>	As you'd expect.
Jul 04 23:59:15 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; Maybe behind the battery too?
Jul 04 23:59:20 <emusan>	yes
Jul 04 23:59:24 <emusan>	that would be perfect
Jul 04 23:59:28 <Exophase>	Oh and please don't put AC in on the side either ;p
Jul 04 23:59:29 <emusan>	then you don't have to open case...
Jul 04 23:59:32 <Exophase>	AC in or USB
Jul 04 23:59:41 <emusan>	do USB for charging
Jul 04 23:59:42 <Exophase>	Or headphones. All are especially bad.
Jul 04 23:59:44 <Exophase>	Or HDMI.
Jul 04 23:59:45 <emusan>	much better in every way
Jul 04 23:59:58 <Exophase>	Not better in one way.
Jul 05 00:00:04 <Exophase>	USB can only provide 500mA
Jul 05 00:00:09 <Exophase>	The wall can provide 2A or more
Jul 05 00:00:10 <emusan>	umm...
Jul 05 00:00:13 <Exophase>	So it can charge much faster.
Jul 05 00:00:20 <Exophase>	Depending on the battery.
Jul 05 00:00:24 <emusan>	I think you can charge over usb using much more
Jul 05 00:00:25 <Exophase>	Damn Pandora can't even charge on USB :/
Jul 05 00:00:27 <emusan>	with otg...
Jul 05 00:00:48 <emusan>	my nook charger can output 750mA
Jul 05 00:00:52 <Exophase>	I don't think so, in fact on Windows computers it defaults to 100mA. You have to have drivers to enable 500.
Jul 05 00:00:52 <emusan>	and my dingoo one
Jul 05 00:01:04 <Exophase>	Well okay, you can charge > 500mA if you plug it into a wall, yeah.
Jul 05 00:01:11 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 05 00:01:18 <emusan>	which you would have to do with AC adapter anyway lol
Jul 05 00:01:19 <Exophase>	But are you going to be able to boot from USB power without a battery?
Jul 05 00:01:28 <Exophase>	You might need a lot of A for startup.
Jul 05 00:01:52 <Exophase>	And I'd be concerned about people trying to boot from their computers.. I dunno.
Jul 05 00:01:58 <emusan>	true...
Jul 05 00:02:05 <emusan>	tell them not to
Jul 05 00:02:11 <emusan>	then beat them if they don't listen
Jul 05 00:03:08 <Exophase>	If it works I don't see a problem, per se.
Jul 05 00:03:14 <Exophase>	But should it come with a wall charger?
Jul 05 00:03:29 <ps2chiper>	no
Jul 05 00:03:35 <ps2chiper>	copper is expensive as hell these days
Jul 05 00:03:36 <emusan>	AC->USB yes
Jul 05 00:03:48 <emusan>	you can get them bulk for cheap I think...
Jul 05 00:03:58 <Exophase>	I don't think people should have to buy something extra just to get the thing to boot if the battery flatlines.
Jul 05 00:04:07 <ps2chiper>	the piece of shit ones that break after a minute, yes those are cheap
Jul 05 00:04:26 <emusan>	agreed exophase
Jul 05 00:04:52 <ps2chiper>	they have to pay for it if its sold separately or included
Jul 05 00:05:20 <Exophase>	That's not the point, paying extra is one thing, having to wait on a second order is another.
Jul 05 00:05:30 <Exophase>	I think if it's something you could end up needing it should be included.
Jul 05 00:05:37 <emusan>	most people do have one lying around though
Jul 05 00:05:41 <emusan>	I've got 5-10 lol
Jul 05 00:05:48 <ps2chiper>	everyone has the psp charger
Jul 05 00:05:52 <emusan>	but including one wouldn't be to bad...
Jul 05 00:05:55 <ps2chiper>	just use that one
Jul 05 00:05:56 <Exophase>	Hum, I guess..
Jul 05 00:06:03 <Triverske>	9 Volt
Jul 05 00:06:03 <emusan>	but thats another port...
Jul 05 00:06:06 <Exophase>	They still need a USB to barrel adapter
Jul 05 00:06:10 <Triverske>	everyone has 8-billion of em
Jul 05 00:06:17 <emusan>	of?
Jul 05 00:06:26 <emusan>	I don't have any USB to barrel adapter's lol
Jul 05 00:06:28 <ps2chiper>	psp 5v adapter
Jul 05 00:06:36 <Exophase>	emusan; Yes you said you want to charge from the wall to USB right?
Jul 05 00:06:55 <Exophase>	I don't have any AC to USB power supplies, I'd need an adapter to go from a standard barrel connector.
Jul 05 00:07:12 <Exophase>	I have car to USB though ;p
Jul 05 00:07:13 <emusan>	lol I don't think thats what ps2chiper meant...
Jul 05 00:07:18 <emusan>	same
Jul 05 00:07:26 <Exophase>	But isn't that what you wanted? No barrel connector.
Jul 05 00:07:32 <ps2chiper>	those wall to usb adapters are too shitty
Jul 05 00:07:35 <emusan>	I think ps2chiper meant have a female barrel on the device...
Jul 05 00:07:41 <ps2chiper>	correct
Jul 05 00:07:46 <ps2chiper>	like the psp
Jul 05 00:07:54 <ps2chiper>	you can charge from adapter or usb
Jul 05 00:08:08 <Exophase>	But you can only boot w/o battery from the barrel connector right?
Jul 05 00:08:11 <Exophase>	Or what
Jul 05 00:08:21 <Exophase>	Or from a wall to USB
Jul 05 00:08:36 <emusan>	that sounds pretty good...
Jul 05 00:08:38 <ps2chiper>	i guess its how you design the power circuit
Jul 05 00:08:48 <emusan>	that power circuit will be fucked up though
Jul 05 00:08:55 <emusan>	I've never seen something do that
Jul 05 00:09:02 <emusan>	at least not without blowing up a few times
Jul 05 00:09:42 <Exophase>	You can get PMICs that take from battery or 5V, and are smart enough to pull from 5V if the battery isn't there or whatever.
Jul 05 00:09:54 <Exophase>	The question is, where that 5V comes from
Jul 05 00:10:40 <ps2chiper>	Triverske, did you redo that photo for 16:10?
Jul 05 00:10:59 <emusan>	but you would have to have seperate lines depending on barrel or USB
Jul 05 00:11:03 <Triverske>	Nope, I'll look into it 
Jul 05 00:11:11 <emusan>	otherwise if you plug in the barrel your USB is suddenly powered
Jul 05 00:11:11 <emusan>	lol
Jul 05 00:11:15 <emusan>	it can be funny
Jul 05 00:11:17 <emusan>	but sad :(
Jul 05 00:11:48 <Exophase>	Triverske; Also, black dpad/sticks?
Jul 05 00:12:04 <emusan>	gold!
Jul 05 00:12:08 <emusan>	make this thing pimp
Jul 05 00:12:13 <emusan>	lol jk
Jul 05 00:12:16 <emusan>	I'm white
Jul 05 00:12:23 <Exophase>	I'm thinking white on those
Jul 05 00:12:34 <Exophase>	And I guess, non Super Famicom colors for the face buttons? >_>
Jul 05 00:12:34 <emusan>	I like black...
Jul 05 00:12:48 <Exophase>	Maybe something outside of ABXY, there was this big controversy on the Pandora boards about this..
Jul 05 00:12:53 <Exophase>	Using them but not using Nintendo convention.
Jul 05 00:13:00 <Exophase>	I dunno what a good alternative is. I like Greek letters ;p
Jul 05 00:13:01 <Triverske>	ah
Jul 05 00:13:17 <Triverske>	Everyone uses abxy
Jul 05 00:13:22 <Triverske>	that's just silly
Jul 05 00:13:27 <emusan>	alpha beta xi omega
Jul 05 00:13:33 <emusan>	sony doesn't
Jul 05 00:13:41 <emusan>	go with abc xyz
Jul 05 00:13:43 <Exophase>	I know, but if you use them in non-Nintendo configuration it gets slightly more confusing for Nintendo emulation.
Jul 05 00:13:44 <emusan>	liek megadrive
Jul 05 00:13:54 <Exophase>	The thing with Greek letters is you can make them look like ABXY ;p
Jul 05 00:14:57 <emusan>	aww, no omega?
Jul 05 00:15:02 <emusan>	it would have to be gamma then?
Jul 05 00:15:20 <Exophase>	Lowercase gamma yeah
Jul 05 00:15:35 <Exophase>	And chi, not xi
Jul 05 00:15:47 <Triverske>	Greek letters?
Jul 05 00:15:52 <Exophase>	Yes
Jul 05 00:16:00 <Exophase>	alpha, beta, chi, theta
Jul 05 00:16:02 <Exophase>	All lowercase
Jul 05 00:16:02 <emusan>	oh sorry... still new to greek lol
Jul 05 00:16:09 <emusan>	theta?
Jul 05 00:16:23 <emusan>	thats O-ish
Jul 05 00:16:26 <Triverske>	I'm convinced greek letters won't work out
Jul 05 00:16:30 <Exophase>	Why :(
Jul 05 00:16:37 <Exophase>	.. meant gamma sorry
Jul 05 00:16:38 <emusan>	I'm convinced the science community would love it
Jul 05 00:16:40 <emusan>	and I would too...
Jul 05 00:17:01 <Exophase>	Then you could use SNES configuration without actually copying SNES!
Jul 05 00:17:41 <emusan>	yay for not being sued!
Jul 05 00:17:57 <emusan>	I think greek would be rather cool
Jul 05 00:18:13 <Triverske>	WRONG
Jul 05 00:18:15 <Triverske>	ALL OF YOU
Jul 05 00:18:20 <Triverske>	it's xbox config
Jul 05 00:18:29 <emusan>	boo xbox
Jul 05 00:18:30 <Exophase>	Look I don't mind if you don't like Greek letters but could you tell us why?
Jul 05 00:18:52 <Exophase>	SNES is at least a little more relevant since it'll be emulating it, not XBox/360
Jul 05 00:18:53 <Triverske>	I'm okay with it, I'm wondering if that's something gamers will like
Jul 05 00:19:02 <emusan>	given how greece is doing right now I'm not sure I would want /my/ console associated with it...
Jul 05 00:19:07 <emusan>	just my opinion..
Jul 05 00:19:08 <Triverske>	lol
Jul 05 00:19:12 <Exophase>	Well, it doesn't have to be a short term decision, you can poll for it.
Jul 05 00:19:20 <Exophase>	Remember, this will appeal more to the older crowd to begin with, than kids
Jul 05 00:19:28 <Triverske>	indeed
Jul 05 00:19:46 <emusan>	or just go with blank ones and let people draw them in...
Jul 05 00:19:51 <emusan>	lol you could do custom keysets
Jul 05 00:19:57 <emusan>	if you make the case easy enough to open
Jul 05 00:20:10 <Triverske>	Also, I'm not going to bother changing that model
Jul 05 00:20:16 <Triverske>	because I need to make a new one
Jul 05 00:20:30 <Exophase>	Oh god I don't like the sound of that. If you do that there should be a config box in the OS where you enter characters for your keys and then you have a standard way for the apps to get it, and if anyone doesn't you bludgeon them.
Jul 05 00:20:44 <Exophase>	Triverske; Yeah that's cool
Jul 05 00:20:49 <Exophase>	I do like the render.
Jul 05 00:21:00 <emusan>	its smexy
Jul 05 00:21:15 <Exophase>	I don't know if it'll be mainstream enough for people, but I know there will be at least some niche that is glad someone's doing this instead of space optimized.
Jul 05 00:22:43 <emusan>	oh, you'll need more buttons on the bottom row for android...
Jul 05 00:22:53 <Exophase>	Which does Android need?
Jul 05 00:22:55 <emusan>	not just start+select, but home, back, etc.
Jul 05 00:23:02 <Exophase>	And does it require multi-touch?
Jul 05 00:23:12 <emusan>	you need home + back + menu
Jul 05 00:23:20 <emusan>	you don't need multitouch on them
Jul 05 00:23:27 <Triverske>	Well as someone once said about the pandora, "This is a damn good niche this thing occupies"
Jul 05 00:23:29 <emusan>	or android in general...
Jul 05 00:23:53 <emusan>	hell the g1 was resistive
Jul 05 00:24:01 <emusan>	its still relevant
Jul 05 00:24:17 <Triverske>	I wonder if the current controls could be used in a way similar to icontrolpad
Jul 05 00:24:26 <emusan>	and home+back+menu is useful in Angstrom as well...
Jul 05 00:24:37 <emusan>	how does icontrolpad do it?
Jul 05 00:25:12 <Exophase>	Do you mean, if it can be used to interface with a phone?
Jul 05 00:25:14 <emusan>	replace start with menu
Jul 05 00:25:52 <ps2chiper>	got the datasheet
Jul 05 00:26:09 <Exophase>	The 1Gbit Eltron RAM one?
Jul 05 00:26:19 <ps2chiper>	yes
Jul 05 00:26:25 <emusan>	in android the dpad and/or analog can do what the trackball normally does
Jul 05 00:26:40 <Triverske>	Exophase, I'm saying if the controls could be compatible with android games/emulators if they have built in iControlpad support
Jul 05 00:26:41 <emusan>	aside from that I dunno
Jul 05 00:26:52 <emusan>	does iControlpad support android?
Jul 05 00:26:54 <emusan>	if so sure
Jul 05 00:27:00 <emusan>	its just software at that point...
Jul 05 00:27:02 <Exophase>	Shouldn't be a problem, Xperia Play can too
Jul 05 00:27:07 <Exophase>	iCP does.
Jul 05 00:27:17 <emusan>	then sure...
Jul 05 00:27:25 <Exophase>	I think Android games usually let you pick controls from whatever set of interfaces reported.
Jul 05 00:27:36 <emusan>	if they're programmed right lol
Jul 05 00:27:45 <Exophase>	For Android it might be best to export them as keyboard events
Jul 05 00:28:07 <emusan>	how does iCP do it?
Jul 05 00:28:53 <emusan>	you would actually normally want the dpad/analog to do trackball then a do trackball click
Jul 05 00:28:57 <Triverske>	keyboard events
Jul 05 00:29:01 <emusan>	so you can navigate...
Jul 05 00:29:10 <emusan>	are we going with clicky analog?
Jul 05 00:29:16 <emusan>	I think it would be fun...
Jul 05 00:29:18 <Exophase>	I think so >_<
Jul 05 00:29:27 <ps2chiper>	http://www.zshare.net/download/922773204f76714a/
Jul 05 00:29:28 <Exophase>	There's an option for clicks on the pot, it's just slightly more expensive.
Jul 05 00:29:51 <emusan>	same pots as before right?
Jul 05 00:29:54 <emusan>	I remember...
Jul 05 00:30:03 <emusan>	I might order some soon to try out my breakout...
Jul 05 00:30:11 <emusan>	if you want I can throw in some for you...
Jul 05 00:30:38 <Exophase>	Yeah CTS 254
Jul 05 00:30:52 <Exophase>	You don't need to buy me anything, if you do I can pay you on PayPal I guess.
Jul 05 00:31:26 <emusan>	na I'd do it free...
Jul 05 00:31:30 <emusan>	they're $4 each
Jul 05 00:31:34 <emusan>	unless you wanted like 100
Jul 05 00:31:35 <emusan>	lol
Jul 05 00:31:41 <Exophase>	Yes I want to make a click monster.
Jul 05 00:31:49 <emusan>	I'm buying 2-4 for myself
Jul 05 00:31:49 <Exophase>	That rolls around on potentiometers.
Jul 05 00:31:50 <emusan>	to play with
Jul 05 00:32:01 <emusan>	wot?
Jul 05 00:32:15 <emusan>	100k or 10k?
Jul 05 00:33:57 <Triverske>	I'll pay for all pre-production and development costs, but I can't afford the entire first batch
Jul 05 00:34:10 <Triverske>	Are we going to have to do pre-orders?
Jul 05 00:34:22 <ps2chiper>	only compatible at 400mhz
Jul 05 00:34:48 <ps2chiper>	so no good for us, maybe ingenic could use them
Jul 05 00:34:50 <emusan>	I think exophase said pre-orders would be okay as long as you don't set a deadline or anything
Jul 05 00:35:12 <Exophase>	I think preorders are okay so long as you don't actually take money upfront :/
Jul 05 00:35:16 <Exophase>	Or only take a small amount..
Jul 05 00:35:25 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; How is that no good?
Jul 05 00:35:30 <emusan>	half up front half after shipment or sumtin
Jul 05 00:35:39 <Exophase>	i.MX53 supports up to 400MHz..
Jul 05 00:35:52 <ps2chiper>	because, you wanted 533mhz, i thought
Jul 05 00:35:55 <Exophase>	Well, I know there's that note to use 533MHz, but I'm not taking that very seriously.
Jul 05 00:36:03 <Exophase>	At worst you can clock down to 333MHz, but I really doubt you'll have to.
Jul 05 00:37:06 <ps2chiper>	Ill look around for any 533mhz suppliers and compare the prices
Jul 05 00:39:36 <ps2chiper>	http://www.winbond.com/hq/enu/ProductAndSales/ProductLines/SpecialtyDRAM/DDR2SDRAM/
Jul 05 00:40:21 <emusan>	ps2chiper how cheap is copper clad(basically pcb blanks) over there?
Jul 05 00:40:53 <ps2chiper>	I never, bought them. ask jaded to find them on taobao
Jul 05 00:40:57 <emusan>	might be an odd question...
Jul 05 00:42:53 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 05 00:42:59 <Triverske>	Question: Is it possible to get this thing under $200? $150?
Jul 05 00:43:14 <ps2chiper>	its 20 rmb for ddr2-1066
Jul 05 00:43:47 <ps2chiper>	http://detail.china.alibaba.com/buyer/offerdetail/645393460.html
Jul 05 00:44:34 <Exophase>	ps2chiper; That Winbond stuff is all too low density, 1gbit is the lowest we can realistically do
Jul 05 00:45:19 <ps2chiper>	well i dont know what you mean by that, I am looking at the 1gb chips when i said that
Jul 05 00:45:38 <Exophase>	I don't see any on that page.
Jul 05 00:45:50 <Exophase>	Oh, never mind :/
Jul 05 00:45:55 <Exophase>	They have an unusual nomenclature
Jul 05 00:46:13 <Exophase>	Usually the Xmbit x Y has the X for total, not pre-multiplied
Jul 05 00:46:25 <Exophase>	And if it means pre-multiplied it won't have "bit" in there
Jul 05 00:46:52 <emusan>	lol that is odd
Jul 05 00:46:53 <Exophase>	Two W972GG6JB will work best
Jul 05 00:47:09 <ps2chiper>	You have a really sharp vocabulary, i forgot about that word. nomenclature
Jul 05 00:47:24 <Exophase>	Second time I used it here today ;)
Jul 05 00:47:25 <emusan>	how much ram would that be?
Jul 05 00:47:44 <Exophase>	Ugh, every time I try to search on alibaba I get connection was reset..
Jul 05 00:47:45 <emusan>	wouldn't that just be 256?
Jul 05 00:47:48 <Exophase>	emusan; 512MB
Jul 05 00:47:52 <emusan>	oh...
Jul 05 00:47:56 <Exophase>	Nah those are 2gbit ones
Jul 05 00:48:03 <emusan>	I see....
Jul 05 00:48:06 <Exophase>	2gbit with 16-bit width
Jul 05 00:48:22 <emusan>	lol didn't see that
Jul 05 00:49:16 <ps2chiper>	I know i used to know how the bit width affected it about 3 years ago, but could you refresh my memory
Jul 05 00:49:32 <Exophase>	We want an effective 32-bit memory.
Jul 05 00:49:46 <Exophase>	And it's looking like we're shooting for 512MB total.
Jul 05 00:49:59 <Exophase>	So if you use 8-bit wide parts you need to connect four in parallel.
Jul 05 00:50:16 <ps2chiper>	i get it now
Jul 05 00:50:23 <Exophase>	If you use 16-bit it can be two, but you still need four if it's only 128MB each, plus you need two chip selects off the SoC instead of one.
Jul 05 00:52:13 <emusan>	any chance we could do another 512 of SWAP?
Jul 05 00:52:25 <emusan>	I really like the thought of 1 gig
Jul 05 00:52:30 <Exophase>	It's up to the user but I never felt comfortable having swap on NAND
Jul 05 00:52:40 <emusan>	lol nokia did it with the n900
Jul 05 00:52:48 <Exophase>	Yeah, that always bugged me a little ;p
Jul 05 00:52:52 <emusan>	but that was 256 hardware
Jul 05 00:52:57 <emusan>	a ton of swap...
Jul 05 00:53:08 <emusan>	its not that bad...
Jul 05 00:53:35 <emusan>	I think if its up to the user though and a dev makes good use of it some users would be left out...
Jul 05 00:53:59 <emusan>	I think it should be a standard if it happens...
Jul 05 00:54:56 <Exophase>	You would be insane to rely on swap in software.
Jul 05 00:55:12 <Exophase>	Swap should only be used for multitasking, not for a single program's working set.
Jul 05 00:55:29 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 05 00:55:31 <emusan>	still a newb lol
Jul 05 00:57:10 <Triverske>	Honestly I don't think we could sell this for over $200
Jul 05 00:57:20 <emusan>	I would buy for more...
Jul 05 00:57:31 <emusan>	but I do think $200 is a sweet point
Jul 05 00:57:45 <emusan>	and most may not go over..
Jul 05 00:58:02 <Triverske>	I really want $150, but I would settle for $200
Jul 05 00:58:06 <emusan>	but given other portables you could probably go up to $225 or even $250
Jul 05 00:58:07 <Exophase>	Triverske; I think you can sell the first 500 for over $200
Jul 05 00:58:08 <ps2chiper>	Here is a fun comparison, http://lightake.com/Search.do/Search.ubuntu http://lightake.com/Search.do/Search.android
Jul 05 00:58:13 <Exophase>	But any after at $200
Jul 05 00:58:38 <Exophase>	BTW, i.MX53 has 2 DDR chip selects.
Jul 05 00:58:49 <Exophase>	So that's the limit. No having four 32-bit modules.
Jul 05 00:58:58 <Exophase>	Each can be up to 1GB
Jul 05 00:59:01 <Exophase>	So the overall limit is 2GB
Jul 05 00:59:27 <emusan>	that would probably be the same given space inside anyway...
Jul 05 00:59:30 <emusan>	four would be a lot...
Jul 05 00:59:41 <Exophase>	We might have to do 4 8-bit modules or 16-bit modules.
Jul 05 00:59:43 <Exophase>	It all depends on the pricing.
Jul 05 00:59:55 <emusan>	ps2chiper I don't really get it...
Jul 05 01:00:13 <emusan>	ubuntu isn't really sold on devices that much...
Jul 05 01:00:14 <ps2chiper>	A ton of android products and 0 ubuntu products
Jul 05 01:00:45 <ps2chiper>	But ubuntu is trying very hard to do that
Jul 05 01:01:03 <Exophase>	I wonder if 2GB will be enough for including Ubuntu and Android..
Jul 05 01:01:18 <emusan>	ubuntu?
Jul 05 01:01:23 <emusan>	I thought angstrom...
Jul 05 01:01:27 <emusan>	but ubuntu is good too...
Jul 05 01:01:39 <Exophase>	I only mention Ubuntu since i.MX53 already has an Ubuntu distro
Jul 05 01:01:44 <Exophase>	Comes with the starter board no less.
Jul 05 01:01:56 <Exophase>	But I don't know if it's really efficient enough, or good for the interface.
Jul 05 01:02:04 <Exophase>	One thing I don't want is PulseAudio :/
Jul 05 01:02:22 <Exophase>	And performance apps should prefer fbdev if possible
Jul 05 01:02:22 <ps2chiper>	it turns out amlogic used ffmpeg to do the video hardware acceleration 
Jul 05 01:02:22 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 05 01:02:38 <Exophase>	You mean they added support to ffmpeg?
Jul 05 01:02:55 <Exophase>	I think the i.MX53 bundled Ubuntu has access to the 1080p hardware too.
Jul 05 01:03:31 <ps2chiper>	it does
Jul 05 01:03:39 <ps2chiper>	like i said a friend already owns the dev board
Jul 05 01:03:50 <Exophase>	Yeah that's right, you did say that didn't you..
Jul 05 01:04:28 <emusan>	does he like it?
Jul 05 01:04:36 <emusan>	we're still doing the quickstart right?
Jul 05 01:04:37 <Exophase>	emusan; Check out some videos on youtube.
Jul 05 01:04:41 <Exophase>	Yeah quickstart is a good deal
Jul 05 01:04:58 <Exophase>	I suppose I'll hook it up to my TV or something.
Jul 05 01:05:06 <emusan>	okay, I just ordered two sticks to test if my breakout works...
Jul 05 01:05:15 <emusan>	if it does I can order more to send out to people...
Jul 05 01:05:31 <emusan>	turns out I only have enough copper clad for two left lol
Jul 05 01:05:46 <emusan>	exophase, or use the VGA...
Jul 05 01:06:03 <Exophase>	That's what I was going to use with my TV
Jul 05 01:06:10 <Exophase>	I don't have any extra monitors lying around you know.
Jul 05 01:06:19 <emusan>	my TV doesn't do VGA :(
Jul 05 01:06:25 <emusan>	it only does DVI...
Jul 05 01:06:29 <Exophase>	Yeah I connect VGA to the box I'm using as an HTPC
Jul 05 01:06:34 <emusan>	I have a DVI->VGA but not other way around...
Jul 05 01:06:37 <Exophase>	It can do HDMI too but I have some sizing issues with it for some reason.
Jul 05 01:06:39 <emusan>	oh...
Jul 05 01:06:49 <emusan>	odd...
Jul 05 01:07:21 <ps2chiper>	doesnt some dvi connections have an analog interface too?
Jul 05 01:07:57 <Exophase>	Yeah it can have either or both
Jul 05 01:09:42 <Triverske>	where does freescale get 1GB of RAM......
Jul 05 01:09:43 <ps2chiper>	so 15rmb for ddr2-800 and 20 rmb for ddr2-1066
Jul 05 01:09:56 <ps2chiper>	I need to go for my bike ride
Jul 05 01:09:56 <emusan>	they use their own I think...
Jul 05 01:10:00 <ps2chiper>	bbl
Jul 05 01:10:04 <emusan>	cya
Jul 05 01:10:09 <Exophase>	Triverske; It's Micron
Jul 05 01:10:15 <emusan>	oh
Jul 05 01:10:15 <Exophase>	4x 256MB 8bit
Jul 05 01:10:33 <Exophase>	You can get that off of Digikey for like $28
Jul 05 01:10:39 <Exophase>	They use DDR3
Jul 05 01:10:54 <Exophase>	The actual part they use goes for like $30 a piece though..
Jul 05 01:10:59 <Exophase>	Or over $20 anyway
Jul 05 01:11:07 <Exophase>	So they clearly have some better price from somewhere, or did
Jul 05 01:11:07 <ps2chiper>	whats the part number
Jul 05 01:11:28 <ps2chiper>	see if they have it on ic37.com and i will check the quotes when i get back
Jul 05 01:11:52 <Exophase>	One  minute
Jul 05 01:13:58 <Exophase>	It is MT41J128M16HA-15E:D
Jul 05 01:14:26 <emusan>	I think he left...
Jul 05 01:14:33 <emusan>	or at least went biking...
Jul 05 01:14:41 <Exophase>	I'll look on ic37.com, but I need to go soon myself.
Jul 05 01:14:52 <emusan>	same
Jul 05 01:14:53 <emusan>	its late
Jul 05 01:14:55 <Exophase>	Note, they use 1GB
Jul 05 01:14:57 <Exophase>	So four of these.
Jul 05 01:15:04 <Exophase>	They're 256MB/16bit each.
Jul 05 01:15:22 <emusan>	wait...
Jul 05 01:15:27 <emusan>	I thought two was max...
Jul 05 01:15:32 <emusan>	how does dev board do more/
Jul 05 01:15:58 <Exophase>	It's not two max, it's two chip-select max.
Jul 05 01:16:06 <emusan>	ah
Jul 05 01:16:08 <Exophase>	Meaning that you can't have four 32-bits, but you can have four 16-bits.
Jul 05 01:16:22 <Exophase>	There you get two per chip-select, to form 32-bit ones.
Jul 05 01:16:26 <emusan>	okay..
Jul 05 01:17:13 <Exophase>	ps2chiper, this part is all over ic37, but far be it from me to know what any of the results mean.
Jul 05 01:17:16 <Exophase>	http://www.ic37.com/sell/search.asp?keyword=MT41J128M16HA&x=0&y=0
Jul 05 01:18:15 <Exophase>	Let me see if they have the Micron 512MB LPDDR2 PoP
Jul 05 01:18:49 <Exophase>	PoP is the only form that i.MX53 accepts LPDDR2, btw..
Jul 05 01:19:20 <emusan>	lol I didn't know what PoP was till you mentioned it the other day...
Jul 05 01:19:23 <emusan>	its wierd
Jul 05 01:19:38 <Exophase>	Yeah..
Jul 05 01:19:44 <Exophase>	ps2chiper, when you get back please look at this
Jul 05 01:19:46 <Exophase>	http://www.ic37.com/sell/search.asp?keyword=MT42L128M32D2KL-25&x=0&y=0
Jul 05 01:19:46 <Exophase>	And this
Jul 05 01:20:06 <Exophase>	http://www.ic37.com/sell/search.asp?keyword=MT42L256M32D4KP-25&x=0&y=0
Jul 05 01:20:15 <Exophase>	If I could just get a ballpark on price..
Jul 05 01:20:38 <Exophase>	This would be nice for performance, power consumption, board space, and component count.
Jul 05 01:21:04 <Exophase>	I don't think board space will be tight, but I have the vague feeling that the more board space is available, the easier layout will be. This is coming from someone who knows nothing about layout though.
Jul 05 01:21:28 <emusan>	more space does mean easier layout
Jul 05 01:21:49 <Exophase>	Those are 512MB and 1GB respectively
Jul 05 01:22:06 <emusan>	so 1 gig is not quite out of the question?
Jul 05 01:22:18 <emusan>	depending on how pricy those are?
Jul 05 01:22:20 <Exophase>	It's not 100% out of the question..
Jul 05 01:22:27 <emusan>	goodie
Jul 05 01:22:28 <Exophase>	i.MX53 quickstart and Pandaboard both have it
Jul 05 01:22:35 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 05 01:22:36 <Exophase>	For $150 and $180 respectively..
Jul 05 01:22:53 <Exophase>	Pandaboard does have a dual channel 1GB PoP from Elpida
Jul 05 01:22:53 <emusan>	but they don't have screens and custom controls and molded cases...
Jul 05 01:23:02 <Exophase>	I know, but they have other stuff too :/
Jul 05 01:23:07 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 05 01:23:13 <Exophase>	I'm sure it won't be enough to make up the difference..
Jul 05 01:23:16 <Exophase>	But still, who knows.
Jul 05 01:23:31 <Exophase>	They're not sold for big profits, but they might not be as cost optimized, because they're low volume.
Jul 05 01:23:36 <emusan>	well it should plus or minus a $100
Jul 05 01:23:40 <Exophase>	And because they're supposed to be easy to design and work with.
Jul 05 01:23:45 <Exophase>	Haha, yeah, maybe.
Jul 05 01:23:51 <emusan>	and I would do $250 for this easy
Jul 05 01:24:03 <Exophase>	I do think selling 500 at $250 wouldn't be difficult.
Jul 05 01:24:07 <Exophase>	And selling more at $200.
Jul 05 01:24:11 <Triverske>	mmmm
Jul 05 01:24:11 <Exophase>	Pandora is selling at $500!
Jul 05 01:24:14 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 05 01:24:21 <emusan>	didn't they stop doing that...
Jul 05 01:24:26 <Triverske>	I want a first production of more than 500 though
Jul 05 01:24:28 <emusan>	cause people got pissed...
Jul 05 01:24:34 <Triverske>	perhaps 2000
Jul 05 01:24:39 <emusan>	thats a lot...
Jul 05 01:24:50 <Exophase>	Just hope homebrew doesn't become trivial on PSV
Jul 05 01:24:52 <emusan>	and then you might run into some of the stuff the pandora guys had...
Jul 05 01:24:55 <Exophase>	Because that'd all but kill this..
Jul 05 01:25:02 <emusan>	lol yeah...
Jul 05 01:25:06 <Exophase>	Homebrew + Android..
Jul 05 01:25:12 <Exophase>	There'd still be some benefits, like SD and HDMI
Jul 05 01:25:14 <emusan>	but I have a feeling sony is going to do a lot to keep it out...
Jul 05 01:25:21 <Triverske>	As well as I
Jul 05 01:25:24 <emusan>	psv is android?
Jul 05 01:25:38 <Exophase>	emusan; No, but they can always make it an option.
Jul 05 01:25:43 <Exophase>	If Sony were smart..
Jul 05 01:25:45 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 05 01:25:52 <Triverske>	ahem (otherOS)
Jul 05 01:25:53 <Exophase>	Just saying. Do I think they will? Not really.
Jul 05 01:25:53 <emusan>	but android has so many holes..
Jul 05 01:26:09 <Triverske>	Sony won't do it
Jul 05 01:26:14 <Exophase>	They don't necessarily have to have Android per se
Jul 05 01:26:20 <Exophase>	But a way to run Android apps.
Jul 05 01:26:23 <Exophase>	Which are pretty damn sandboxed
Jul 05 01:26:29 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 05 01:26:33 <Exophase>	Even if they didn't allow NDK, it'd still help them.
Jul 05 01:27:30 <Triverske>	Anyway, I'll have to make my money back somehow
Jul 05 01:27:31 <emusan>	how long do you estimate it will be before the vita gets hacked?
Jul 05 01:27:38 <Triverske>	4 years
Jul 05 01:27:46 <emusan>	thats awhile
Jul 05 01:27:47 <Exophase>	Anyway, even if PSV got all that you'd still sell 500, because there are a lot of people who are passionate about "proper" open source stuff.
Jul 05 01:27:59 <emusan>	aka gp2x
Jul 05 01:28:05 <Exophase>	I mean, GP2X came out after PSP could run homebrew and was worse in pretty much every way.
Jul 05 01:28:10 <Exophase>	But still got better emulators for the most part.
Jul 05 01:28:21 <Exophase>	And still had no problem sellings tens of thousands.
Jul 05 01:28:30 <Giroro>	First run should be targeted at devs
Jul 05 01:28:33 <Exophase>	Despite flaws which I certainly hope this won't have.
Jul 05 01:28:37 <emusan>	hi giroro
Jul 05 01:28:42 <Giroro>	hey guys. 
Jul 05 01:28:43 <Exophase>	500 is a lot for dev targeted, I'd say broader than that.
Jul 05 01:28:56 <Exophase>	You could have a smaller run of around 20-30 or so before that?
Jul 05 01:28:57 <emusan>	I think dev's will get the quick starts lol
Jul 05 01:29:30 <emusan>	would you give them away like pandora?
Jul 05 01:29:48 <Exophase>	Not as freely as they did, there were some they never saw again..
Jul 05 01:29:59 <Exophase>	They should have never sent one to me to be honest ;p Although I did send mine off to someone else.
Jul 05 01:29:59 <emusan>	lol
Jul 05 01:30:03 <emusan>	not surprising
Jul 05 01:30:08 <Exophase>	I mean, the bare boards they sent.
Jul 05 01:30:17 <Exophase>	I didn't have time to do much for it.
Jul 05 01:30:17 <emusan>	did you do anything with it?
Jul 05 01:30:21 <emusan>	ah
Jul 05 01:30:30 <emusan>	but youll do stuff for this right?
Jul 05 01:30:34 <Triverske>	Let's say I'm getting $20 for every unit, If I sold all 500 I'd have 5% of my investment back
Jul 05 01:30:38 <emusan>	I mean you already are...
Jul 05 01:30:45 <Exophase>	I've been working on my real one somewhat though
Jul 05 01:31:02 <Exophase>	It wouldn't be smart to hold me responsible to too much >_>
Jul 05 01:31:20 <Exophase>	The amount of kernel and userspace work they did for Pandora was staggering..
Jul 05 01:31:37 <emusan>	Triverske, thats assuming that it costs $200000 to get a prototype alone though right?
Jul 05 01:31:38 <Exophase>	There's no way I could do work on the level of what notaz, DJWillis, or skeezix did there.
Jul 05 01:32:04 <emusan>	lol any chance they would help out here?
Jul 05 01:32:09 <Exophase>	Triverske; $20 gross??
Jul 05 01:32:20 <Exophase>	Or $20 profit?
Jul 05 01:32:27 <Triverske>	$20 profit
Jul 05 01:32:42 <Exophase>	So you'd make 5% profit
Jul 05 01:32:53 <Exophase>	When you say "5% of my investment back" that makes it sound like you're losing 95%
Jul 05 01:32:58 <emusan>	lol thats how my math worked out...
Jul 05 01:33:11 <Triverske>	I would have to sell 10000+ to turn a profit
Jul 05 01:33:22 <Triverske>	and that's even if I get $20 profit
Jul 05 01:33:44 <emusan>	I think you're assuming that it will cost all of your investment to get the first one out the door...
Jul 05 01:33:47 <ps2chiper>	You need to double your money
Jul 05 01:33:56 <emusan>	I don't think it will...
Jul 05 01:33:57 <ps2chiper>	if it cost 100 dollars to build, you sell for 200
Jul 05 01:33:58 <Exophase>	Profit should include initial investment.
Jul 05 01:34:09 <ps2chiper>	thats the rule of thumb in china
Jul 05 01:34:26 <Exophase>	I don't think we can manage those kinds of margins at first.
Jul 05 01:34:33 <Exophase>	500 is just to get it off the ground.
Jul 05 01:34:46 <Exophase>	I'm sure you'll make more than $20 per unit after that batch though.
Jul 05 01:34:52 <ps2chiper>	the reason you double the price is so you have room to work with other sellers
Jul 05 01:34:58 <ps2chiper>	and whole sale discounts
Jul 05 01:35:07 <ps2chiper>	if you only have a 5% profit
Jul 05 01:35:19 <ps2chiper>	other companies will be insulted if you cant give them a large break
Jul 05 01:35:39 <Exophase>	That's assuming other companies will want to carry a large supply of these..
Jul 05 01:35:44 <Exophase>	That's quite a long ways off..
Jul 05 01:35:50 <emusan>	ya
Jul 05 01:35:55 <emusan>	this isn't the nD after all
Jul 05 01:35:56 <emusan>	lol
Jul 05 01:36:16 <Exophase>	It's an emulator device, it's too high end to sell well in China and not high end enough to sell well enough everywhere else ;p
Jul 05 01:36:27 <Exophase>	Not high end enough/not with enough exclusive software
Jul 05 01:36:36 <emusan>	well, I must be heading to bed...
Jul 05 01:36:39 <emusan>	night all!
Jul 05 01:36:44 <ps2chiper>	good night
Jul 05 01:36:46 <Exophase>	It'd probably sell just like GPH products, 50k at the upper end
Jul 05 01:37:13 <Exophase>	I guess no point fixating too much on price until we can get a BOM together though?
Jul 05 01:37:14 <--	emusan has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Jul 05 01:38:21 <Exophase>	Anyway Triverske, one flaw with your math is that you're saying none of the $200k is being used on the cost of the 500 units themselves. I think a majority of your spending will be on that, with the R&D overhead not being anywhere close to the $200k.
Jul 05 01:38:45 <Triverske>	I hate this job
Jul 05 01:38:46 <ps2chiper>	marketing is the most important part
Jul 05 01:38:58 <ps2chiper>	you need to spend over half your budget on that alone
Jul 05 01:39:06 <Exophase>	Not to sell 500, that's for sure.
Jul 05 01:39:16 <Exophase>	Or to sell 5000 for that matter.
Jul 05 01:39:16 <ps2chiper>	he needs to plan for 2 years
Jul 05 01:39:18 <Triverske>	Marketing is not problem
Jul 05 01:39:25 <Exophase>	I doubt Pandora spent a cent on marketing.
Jul 05 01:39:31 <Exophase>	Outside of maybe sending a few units to a few people.
Jul 05 01:39:42 <beoran2>	if the device is cool it will be high in demand amongst us "hackers"
Jul 05 01:39:56 <ps2chiper>	got to go again
Jul 05 01:40:01 <Exophase>	The way I see it, even if this had the appeal to be mainstream, it won't have the lifespan for it.
Jul 05 01:40:13 <Exophase>	Because by the time production reached that point it'd be too old hardware-wise.
Jul 05 01:40:20 <beoran2>	once that's arranged , though, you'll need marketing too sell it to the people
Jul 05 01:40:27 <Exophase>	But you could perhaps design a successor to be more mainstream. By then you might get other parties interested in backing you.
Jul 05 01:40:56 <Exophase>	beoran2, what do you think about Triverske's render? http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/protok.png/ 
Jul 05 01:41:10 <beoran2>	The CPU you're interested in is quite modern, though. 
Jul 05 01:41:18 <Exophase>	It's not high end by any means..
Jul 05 01:41:29 <Exophase>	It's pretty mid-2010 all told.
Jul 05 01:41:40 <Exophase>	High end would be dual Cortex-A9
Jul 05 01:41:46 <Exophase>	That'd be sweet.
Jul 05 01:41:49 <beoran2>	the render looks cool though
Jul 05 01:41:54 <Exophase>	Yeah I like the render.
Jul 05 01:42:03 <Exophase>	We were arguing about whether or not anyone would like Greek letter face buttons.
Jul 05 01:42:24 <Exophase>	Lowercase alpha, beta, chi, and gamma
Jul 05 01:42:32 <beoran2>	internationally speaking: no
Jul 05 01:42:44 <Exophase>	Aw, how come?
Jul 05 01:42:53 <beoran2>	most people don't know tgreek to begin with 
Jul 05 01:42:59 <Exophase>	Doesn't matter!
Jul 05 01:43:09 <beoran2>	the roman alphabet is more widely known
Jul 05 01:43:25 <beoran2>	I'd actually number the buttons 1-8 or so 
Jul 05 01:43:31 <Exophase>	Who cares? You can use whatever symbols so long as they're easily identifiable. Actually, people might end up just calling them a, b, x, and y..
Jul 05 01:43:45 <Exophase>	Since they look like that, but you technically avoid ripping off Nintendo while still being able to use SNES arrangement ;p
Jul 05 01:44:00 <beoran2>	Exophase: true that, so that's why I'd use numbers. 
Jul 05 01:44:10 <Exophase>	I dunno, numbers seem so plain :(
Jul 05 01:44:36 <beoran2>	sure, but they're internationally widely recognised
Jul 05 01:44:52 <beoran2>	Not to ention supported by unicode, which wrmkes writings docs easier
Jul 05 01:44:56 <Giroro>	numbers would look too much like a super-cheap PC gamepad
Jul 05 01:45:50 <Exophase>	Meh, greek is pretty typical on unicode
Jul 05 01:45:59 <beoran2>	①②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧
Jul 05 01:46:11 <beoran2>	There you go, 8 buttons :)
Jul 05 01:46:39 <Exophase>	Greek is very widely used in the scientific communities internationally, since we'll be appealing mainly to the older technically oriented crowd I think a large percentage will be familiar with them.
Jul 05 01:46:47 <Exophase>	Greek letters I mean, not the language
Jul 05 01:47:32 <Triverske>	wait a second
Jul 05 01:47:39 <Exophase>	No point arguing it much though, I guess I don't really know what people would want.
Jul 05 01:47:43 <Exophase>	Or accept.
Jul 05 01:48:08 <Triverske>	alpha beta gamma and chi are A,B,X, and Y
Jul 05 01:48:09 <Exophase>	Probably best on a ranking poll.. let people vote by order, so if one is really hated it'll be evident
Jul 05 01:48:15 <Exophase>	Triverske; Not exactly!
Jul 05 01:48:22 <Exophase>	They look a little different.
Jul 05 01:48:32 <Triverske>	Well yes
Jul 05 01:48:35 <Exophase>	That's the idea.
Jul 05 01:49:00 <beoran2>	I'd gi fir simple, really. Remember tha twe develpers will have to write docs for our games. It's easier if it's availabe on a normal keyboard.
Jul 05 01:49:11 <Triverske>	So to smart people they'll see greek symbols, and to normal people they'll see A,B,X, and Y
Jul 05 01:49:27 <beoran2>	ah, I know, how about this: - + * / 
Jul 05 01:49:31 <Exophase>	I'm sure developers won't be pissed if they have to paste special characters, or they can just spell it out.
Jul 05 01:49:45 <Exophase>	beoran2; I'm gonna go with maybe.
Jul 05 01:49:59 <Exophase>	I'll tell you this much - when it was polled on the Pandora boards ABXY in the SNES configuration was by far the most popular way to put ABXY
Jul 05 01:50:00 <beoran2>	well, trhis is paining the bike shed really
Jul 05 01:50:10 <Exophase>	But the Pandora people didn't want to antagonize Nintendo.
Jul 05 01:50:15 <Exophase>	Yes, yes it is.
Jul 05 01:50:23 <beoran2>	so what did pandora use
Jul 05 01:50:24 <beoran2>	?
Jul 05 01:50:26 <Exophase>	Triverske; That's sort of the trick yeah.
Jul 05 01:50:32 <Exophase>	ABXY in some.. other configuration..
Jul 05 01:50:44 <beoran2>	well, let's copy them then :)
Jul 05 01:50:45 <Exophase>	A on left, B on right, X on bottom, Y on top
Jul 05 01:50:53 <Exophase>	People were kind of unhappy about it..
Jul 05 01:51:10 <Triverske>	α β γ χ
Jul 05 01:51:11 <beoran2>	Ok, well then the greek letter trick might do the trick
Jul 05 01:51:20 <Exophase>	Because it's the same as GP2X
Jul 05 01:51:35 <beoran2>	In capitals it's even better... but not different enough 
Jul 05 01:51:35 <Exophase>	And they didn't like being GP2X-like
Jul 05 01:51:52 <Exophase>	I think the lowercase look more stylish, but maybe that's just me
Jul 05 01:52:37 <beoran2>	ΑΒΓΧ
Jul 05 01:52:48 <beoran2>	α β γ χ
Jul 05 01:53:16 <beoran2>	well if the whole poin tis /not/ to copy ninty, then lowercase greek is best.
Jul 05 01:53:41 <Exophase>	Plus uppercase gamma does not look like a Y
Jul 05 01:53:46 <Exophase>	So it just looks like you're.. one off.
Jul 05 01:53:50 <Exophase>	It looks like a hang-man :D
Jul 05 01:53:53 <beoran2>	exactly
Jul 05 01:54:24 <beoran2>	although you could yse the greek upsilon:  ΑΒΥΧ
Jul 05 01:54:34 <beoran2>	in which case it's indistinguishable
Jul 05 01:54:43 <beoran2>	Or, you could also use runes
Jul 05 01:56:10 <Triverske>	I'm still wondering what the cost per unit will be
Jul 05 01:56:17 <beoran2>	ᚢᛒᛞᛉ
Jul 05 01:56:35 <beoran2>	Triverske: well, let's order of magnitude it ?
Jul 05 01:56:51 <beoran2>	25$ for the cpu ,if it's the imx538, roight?
Jul 05 01:57:07 <Triverske>	$22
Jul 05 01:57:29 <beoran2>	5$ for memory, 5$ for sound chip, 
Jul 05 01:57:41 <Exophase>	No way, at least $10 for RAM
Jul 05 01:57:45 <beoran2>	what resolution is the screen?
Jul 05 01:57:53 <Triverske>	800*480
Jul 05 01:57:56 <Exophase>	800x480, I think we're looking at $20 there maybe
Jul 05 01:58:01 <Exophase>	135 rmb afaik
Jul 05 01:58:05 <beoran2>	Exophase: more 25$ 
Jul 05 01:58:24 <Exophase>	This is without touch builtin though
Jul 05 01:58:40 <beoran2>	so already $22 + $10 +$5 + $25
Jul 05 01:58:47 <--	Syniphas has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 05 01:58:51 <beoran2>	you want touch ?
Jul 05 01:59:08 <Exophase>	I think so..
Jul 05 01:59:10 <Triverske>	Touch is a necessity 
Jul 05 01:59:16 <Exophase>	The sound chip on the quick start board is only $1.36
Jul 05 01:59:21 <Exophase>	From Digikey, for 2500 though
Jul 05 01:59:21 <beoran2>	Ok, then screen + touch will be around 30$, I think
Jul 05 01:59:25 -->	Syniphas (~syn@E37D1A92.FCCFB762.9AA013FF.IP) has joined #nD
Jul 05 01:59:49 <beoran2>	well, I'm calculation the cost fpor the first prototype, a worst-case scenario if you like
Jul 05 01:59:55 <Exophase>	The analog stick pots are about $5 for both..
Jul 05 02:00:03 <beoran2>	ok
Jul 05 02:00:24 <Exophase>	$2.50 for the internal SD
Jul 05 02:00:53 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $5 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 
Jul 05 02:01:12 <beoran2>	(I tound fractions up for ease of cvalulation, it's a worst case scenario) 
Jul 05 02:02:23 <beoran2>	still needed: the PCB, the shell, wiring, the battery, a power supply chip, the buttons, a headphone jack, two loudspeakers, a USB connection
Jul 05 02:02:46 <Exophase>	I'm trying to find a price on the PMIC
Jul 05 02:02:52 <Exophase>	The one used on the QSB isn't listed anywhere.
Jul 05 02:03:01 <Triverske>	I'll find a price on TRRS
Jul 05 02:03:07 <Exophase>	And the one for i.MX51 allegedly isn't good for i.MX53..
Jul 05 02:03:16 <Exophase>	But the i.MX53 one Freescale is coming out with might be similarly priced...
Jul 05 02:03:58 <beoran2>	well, what is that price? 
Jul 05 02:04:13 <Exophase>	That one is at least $3.59..
Jul 05 02:04:16 <beoran2>	normaly it should be similar, but let's increase it a bit
Jul 05 02:04:16 <Exophase>	More expensive than I thought :/
Jul 05 02:04:22 <Exophase>	I guess go with $5
Jul 05 02:04:23 <beoran2>	ok, so let's say $5
Jul 05 02:04:36 <beoran2>	PMIC is the power supply chip, right?
Jul 05 02:04:38 <Exophase>	We need an HDMI chip too.
Jul 05 02:04:39 <Exophase>	Yes
Jul 05 02:04:43 <Exophase>	Power Management IC
Jul 05 02:04:47 <beoran2>	ah, you want to do TV out
Jul 05 02:04:49 <beoran2>	?
Jul 05 02:04:51 <Exophase>	Yeah.
Jul 05 02:05:09 <Exophase>	Let me find the one used on the daughter card for the QMS.
Jul 05 02:05:18 <Exophase>	We'll obviously need some transceivers, opamps, buffers, whatever
Jul 05 02:05:19 <beoran2>	ok, hdmi sounds expensive though, and I think... the CPU can't handle it?
Jul 05 02:05:23 <Exophase>	And a bunch of passives.
Jul 05 02:05:38 <Exophase>	The display controller can handle it with the right chip.
Jul 05 02:05:41 <beoran2>	I though it went up to VGA
Jul 05 02:05:49 <Exophase>	It has 1080p video decode, best to be able to use it right?
Jul 05 02:05:54 <beoran2>	ok, I guess HDMI will be +-10$
Jul 05 02:05:59 <Exophase>	Let me look.
Jul 05 02:06:03 <Triverske>	7 cents for the headphone jack
Jul 05 02:06:24 <beoran2>	static components, probably +-5$
Jul 05 02:07:03 <Exophase>	The $50 HDMI card uses Silicon Image SiI9022
Jul 05 02:07:26 <Exophase>	Which I'm not finding listed anywhere.
Jul 05 02:07:47 <Exophase>	http://www.siliconimage.com/products/product.aspx?pid=118
Jul 05 02:08:31 <Exophase>	Checking the sales contacts on their site..
Jul 05 02:09:54 <Exophase>	It's $3.48 at Symmetry
Jul 05 02:10:00 <Exophase>	http://www.semiconductorstore.com/cart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=45403
Jul 05 02:10:33 <Exophase>	QMS guide says it needs chokes on that card too, to pass FCC
Jul 05 02:10:42 <Exophase>	No idea how much those cost.
Jul 05 02:10:46 <Exophase>	Probably not a lot??
Jul 05 02:11:15 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $5 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4
Jul 05 02:11:44 <beoran2>	chokes are probably pasive, so probably cheap
Jul 05 02:11:45 <Exophase>	Okay, but not $5 on sound, $2 ;p
Jul 05 02:11:55 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4
Jul 05 02:11:58 <beoran2>	:)
Jul 05 02:11:59 <Exophase>	$81
Jul 05 02:12:10 <beoran2>	we're not there yet
Jul 05 02:12:13 <Triverske>	Case time
Jul 05 02:12:15 <Exophase>	Yeah I know.
Jul 05 02:12:28 <Exophase>	ps2chiper gave some number for batteries but I don't remember it.
Jul 05 02:12:37 <beoran2>	stiil ,shell, wiring, passives, wire, OH, and bluetooth or wifi
Jul 05 02:12:59 <beoran2>	I see rechargeable batteries (3v) go around 15$
Jul 05 02:13:07 <Exophase>	Ah yeah, I kept meaning to find a lead on the BT/Wifi chip, ps2chiper mentioned one from Marvell. But Marvell's site has been down since then.
Jul 05 02:13:20 <Exophase>	Lithium Ion, Lithium Polymer, or what?
Jul 05 02:13:26 <Exophase>	And you mean 3.7V?
Jul 05 02:13:33 <Exophase>	3V is what those Lithium coin cell batteries put out.
Jul 05 02:13:48 <beoran2>	no, simply like this: http://www.batterijenhuis.nl/?gclid=CNi38OzD6akCFUEa4Qod-Hc5Xg
Jul 05 02:13:53 <Exophase>	We're looking for somewhere around 2000mAh IMO
Jul 05 02:13:57 <Exophase>	http://www.dealextreme.com/p/replacement-rechargeable-3-7v-2000mah-lithium-battery-pack-with-screwdriver-for-nintendo-3ds-65064
Jul 05 02:14:04 <beoran2>	Two rechargeable AA batteries bound together
Jul 05 02:14:07 <Exophase>	Something not unlike this? If Deal Extreme can sell them for $5 we can get them for $5
Jul 05 02:14:38 <Exophase>	(probably much less)
Jul 05 02:14:48 <Triverske>	3.30
Jul 05 02:14:52 <Triverske>	for a 2600mah
Jul 05 02:14:56 <Exophase>	AAs are just too thick
Jul 05 02:14:58 <[]J>	A game console for 3dollars
Jul 05 02:15:01 <Exophase>	Triverske; OK, so long as size is good let's go with that.
Jul 05 02:15:02 <beoran2>	Well, let's worse case it to $5
Jul 05 02:15:09 *	[]J tomagochi (sp)
Jul 05 02:15:22 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 
Jul 05 02:15:34 <Triverske>	http://detail.china.alibaba.com/buyer/offerdetail/885441348.html
Jul 05 02:15:41 <Triverske>	^battery
Jul 05 02:16:12 <Exophase>	The Marvell chip I got pointed to was 88W8686
Jul 05 02:16:23 <beoran2>	because a cheap battery may be leaky
Jul 05 02:16:55 <Exophase>	Enh, it may not have BT :/
Jul 05 02:17:07 <Exophase>	Nope, no BT..
Jul 05 02:17:13 <beoran2>	what's BT?
Jul 05 02:17:19 <Exophase>	Bluetooth
Jul 05 02:17:28 <beoran2>	oh, yeah, it's easeir to get a combined chip
Jul 05 02:18:14 <Exophase>	88W8688 instead
Jul 05 02:19:34 <Exophase>	I can't find it for sale though.
Jul 05 02:20:23 <Triverske>	found it
Jul 05 02:20:27 <Exophase>	Link?
Jul 05 02:20:55 <Triverske>	http://detail.china.alibaba.com/buyer/offerdetail/901600976.html
Jul 05 02:21:14 <Triverske>	in shenzhen too
Jul 05 02:21:22 <Exophase>	Oh wow.
Jul 05 02:21:23 <Exophase>	Cheap.
Jul 05 02:21:37 <Triverske>	55 cents
Jul 05 02:21:42 <Exophase>	Okay, $1 for that
Jul 05 02:21:46 <beoran2>	worst case 1$ :)
Jul 05 02:21:58 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1
Jul 05 02:22:13 <beoran2>	passives? 
Jul 05 02:22:21 <beoran2>	probably just 5$?
Jul 05 02:22:22 <Triverske>	Triverske
Jul 05 02:22:38 <Exophase>	For USB we wanted to have a hub to get two hosts, but understand that i.MX53 does have multiple USB host (3), just that only one has an integrated PHY.
Jul 05 02:22:54 <Exophase>	So I don't know what the better solution is, to add a hub or add a PHY.
Jul 05 02:22:57 <Exophase>	I would think it's to add a PHY.
Jul 05 02:23:39 <beoran2>	why 2? 
Jul 05 02:23:48 <beoran2>	people can easily connect a hub themxelves
Jul 05 02:23:49 <Exophase>	I don't know about passives, except that it'll probably be a similar count to the amount on the QSB, unless you have to add a bunch of termination for the LCD.
Jul 05 02:24:17 <Exophase>	beoran2; What we want is to have an external USB host for standard peripherals, then have one inside the battery compartment so you can add a 3G or whatever dongle without sticking out of the unit.
Jul 05 02:24:53 <Exophase>	And a USB OTG.. there's an integrated PHY for that too, so I think you just need some passives and the connector (which should be super cheap)
Jul 05 02:25:04 <Exophase>	Are we gonna have motion sensors?
Jul 05 02:25:14 <Exophase>	Triaxial accelerometers are cheap
Jul 05 02:25:20 <beoran2>	doidn't the cpu come with one included?
Jul 05 02:25:22 <Exophase>	IIRC 10-15 rmb
Jul 05 02:25:35 <Exophase>	An accelerometer on an SoC? Man, that'd be the day.
Jul 05 02:25:48 <beoran2>	probably I mistook then ...
Jul 05 02:26:01 <beoran2>	anyway, if the're cheap, it could be a nice gimmic
Jul 05 02:26:02 <Exophase>	Oh, I forgot.
Jul 05 02:26:13 <Exophase>	We need a microcontroller to interface the pots and any other analog sense components (if any)
Jul 05 02:26:31 <beoran2>	Exophase: the CPO has GPIO for that
Jul 05 02:26:34 <Exophase>	I'm partial to Cortex-M3, which you can get for under $1 (but you'll find it more like $1.50 on digikey)
Jul 05 02:26:49 <Exophase>	Analog sticks need ADCs
Jul 05 02:26:51 <Exophase>	Not GPIOs
Jul 05 02:27:14 <beoran2>	yeah, I realised now. 
Jul 05 02:27:16 <Triverske>	My brain's yuan to dollar converter has become quite accurate now
Jul 05 02:27:20 <Exophase>	Plus it's nice to have something that can do signal conditioning without weighing down your CPU
Jul 05 02:27:23 <beoran2>	Well, then +2$ for an ADC
Jul 05 02:27:39 <Exophase>	No just buy a microcontroller, not a discrete ADC, trust me.
Jul 05 02:27:52 <Exophase>	Those have loads of ADC inputs these days, 12-bit, all you need
Jul 05 02:27:57 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + microcontroller: 2$
Jul 05 02:28:28 <Exophase>	You CAN go cheaper if you get an AVR or other 8-bitter but I wouldn't do it unless it becomes a space issue,.
Jul 05 02:28:53 <Giroro>	so thats $92 so far if i'mm adding correctly
Jul 05 02:29:02 <beoran2>	https://gist.github.com/1064333
Jul 05 02:29:02 <Exophase>	Alright, what else?
Jul 05 02:29:14 <beoran2>	how about that second usb then? 
Jul 05 02:29:28 <Exophase>	I don't know the first thing about what plastic costs. I can ask some people at work what PCB fab and assembly might cost..
Jul 05 02:29:40 <beoran2>	and then wiring, connectors, shell, button, PCB
Jul 05 02:29:54 <beoran2>	well, there are shops that amke a PCB for you to design
Jul 05 02:30:03 <Exophase>	When you say wiring are you including component assembly?
Jul 05 02:30:10 <beoran2>	plastic is dirt cheep, but the toolling costrs are not
Jul 05 02:30:15 <Exophase>	Because the hand wiring should be very simple.
Jul 05 02:30:23 <Exophase>	I mean, very limited
Jul 05 02:30:28 <beoran2>	Exophase: I'm not including labour costs just yet
Jul 05 02:30:30 <Exophase>	Maybe just the speakers
Jul 05 02:30:46 <beoran2>	ah yes, how much are those?
Jul 05 02:30:50 <beoran2>	https://gist.github.com/1064333
Jul 05 02:30:55 <Triverske>	not much at all
Jul 05 02:30:58 <Exophase>	The speakers are the only thing I KNOW will have wires going from them to the motherboard.
Jul 05 02:31:03 <beoran2>	To keep a record I made the gist above.
Jul 05 02:31:06 <Exophase>	Well.
Jul 05 02:31:08 <Triverske>	I need a diameter though
Jul 05 02:31:13 <Exophase>	Actually I dunno, can you get throughhole speakers?
Jul 05 02:31:19 <beoran2>	as small as possible is best
Jul 05 02:31:30 <Exophase>	That'd make end level assembly easier.
Jul 05 02:32:28 <ps2chiper>	ic37.com is a dealer locater website
Jul 05 02:32:41 <ps2chiper>	you just email them with how many chips you need and they send back quotes
Jul 05 02:32:58 <beoran2>	I found a PCB shop: 50$ fpor a proytotype, 5$ dfor a series run
Jul 05 02:33:14 <beoran2>	http://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/produkte/leiterplatten.html
Jul 05 02:33:23 <Exophase>	http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/products/7166450/ < something like this is through hole, obviously you'd want smaller but that idea right?
Jul 05 02:33:44 <ps2chiper>	You also forgot a 8 layer pcb cost
Jul 05 02:33:48 <ps2chiper>	I think 10 dollars
Jul 05 02:33:52 <Triverske>	40 cents for 2 speakers
Jul 05 02:34:08 <Exophase>	Triverske; Do you have to solder wires to the board or do you solder the speaker straight to the board?
Jul 05 02:34:35 <Triverske>	these look like you have to solder wire
Jul 05 02:34:45 <Triverske>	however
Jul 05 02:35:05 <Exophase>	Just curious really
Jul 05 02:35:18 <beoran2>	does ythe PCB need to be 8 layer?
Jul 05 02:35:27 <Exophase>	beoran2; Probably :/
Jul 05 02:35:36 <beoran2>	ok, then $10it is :)
Jul 05 02:35:53 <Exophase>	The QMS is 8 layer, for reference.
Jul 05 02:36:03 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + microcontroller: 2$ + speakers: $1 + PCB: $10
Jul 05 02:36:07 <Exophase>	QSB I mean, sorry.
Jul 05 02:37:19 <Exophase>	HDMI license, 5 cents ;p
Jul 05 02:37:41 <Exophase>	I wonder how much silk screening costs, I imagine that's bundled into the plastics cost?
Jul 05 02:39:23 <beoran2>	you mean, a you need a separate plastic creen?
Jul 05 02:40:01 <Exophase>	Silk screening is for printing writing on the case.
Jul 05 02:40:11 <Exophase>	Like for the HDMI logo to save 10 cents on licensing.
Jul 05 02:40:18 <Exophase>	But labels for all the other ports.
Jul 05 02:40:28 <beoran2>	http://www.pei2000.com/
Jul 05 02:40:54 <beoran2>	Labels are cheap, though, 
Jul 05 02:40:59 <Exophase>	I think doing the plastics in China is pretty much a given, or at least some eastern country
Jul 05 02:41:11 <Exophase>	Trying to get a mould made in the USA or western Europe will cost you a ton more.
Jul 05 02:41:23 <--	Syniphas has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 05 02:41:36 <Exophase>	Not to say that there aren't some good places for prototyping though.
Jul 05 02:42:10 <Exophase>	Oh, huh, up to 10000 here on reoreder.. I wonder how high quality these are without molds.
Jul 05 02:44:00 <Triverske>	are we down to the case?
Jul 05 02:44:56 <beoran2>	yes, the case it is now
Jul 05 02:46:29 <ps2chiper>	does that company do vacuum molding?
Jul 05 02:47:55 <beoran2>	no, it's not a good company that link I send
Jul 05 02:48:14 <Triverske>	what are we up to?
Jul 05 02:48:31 <beoran2>	however, since I am a polymer scientist by education I'm going to say you can get the casing for $10
Jul 05 02:48:42 <beoran2>	the prototype may be $100 or even more though.
Jul 05 02:49:26 <ps2chiper>	dont you need to cnc some wood or something, then vacuum mold the plastic
Jul 05 02:49:27 <beoran2>	plastics really is cheap(as long as the oil price doesn' trise dramatically)
Jul 05 02:50:32 <ps2chiper>	injection molding is much cheaper
Jul 05 02:50:39 <beoran2>	also, the screen needs a separate cover? 
Jul 05 02:50:50 <ps2chiper>	around 1 usd each component 
Jul 05 02:50:52 <beoran2>	yes, injection molding is pretty standard. 
Jul 05 02:51:12 <ps2chiper>	Do you do cad?
Jul 05 02:51:21 <beoran2>	well, we still need the battery cover, the buttons, and the front and backside of the shell, so...
Jul 05 02:51:31 <ps2chiper>	not for a prototype
Jul 05 02:51:47 <beoran2>	ps2chiper: I'm a programmer by profession though, so I don't do much CAD, no. I could probably learn it.. :p
Jul 05 02:52:17 <beoran2>	ps2chiper: my meaning is: a prototypoe you can show to investors
Jul 05 02:52:26 <beoran2>	that needs a case too.
Jul 05 02:52:30 <ps2chiper>	got to go 
Jul 05 02:52:39 <beoran2>	so I'd sat 10$ for all plastics then.
Jul 05 02:52:52 <Triverske>	Which brings us to a price of?
Jul 05 02:52:54 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + microcontroller: 2$ + speakers: $1 + PCB: $10 + plastics: $10
Jul 05 02:53:23 <Triverske>	$110
Jul 05 02:53:25 <beoran2>	so already cpu: $22 + mem: $10 + sound: $2 + scree+touch:$30 + pots:$5 + sd: $3.0 + PMIC: $5 + HDMI: $4 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + microcontroller: 2$ + speakers: $1 + PCB: $10 + plastics: $10 + statics/wiring/screws: $5
Jul 05 02:53:34 <Triverske>	$115
Jul 05 02:53:41 <beoran2>	forgot anything?
Jul 05 02:54:05 <Triverske>	shipping?
Jul 05 02:54:19 <beoran2>	no, it's just the hardware now
Jul 05 02:54:21 <ps2chiper>	smt
Jul 05 02:54:36 <beoran2>	smt?
Jul 05 02:54:45 <ps2chiper>	pick and place machine cost
Jul 05 02:55:04 <beoran2>	oh yeah, the machine that install the parts on the PCB
Jul 05 02:55:43 <beoran2>	how mych that? $10???
Jul 05 02:58:19 <beoran2>	so total: $125 hardware cost
Jul 05 02:59:23 <beoran2>	$128 actually
Jul 05 02:59:47 <Triverske>	selling for $179.99
Jul 05 03:00:16 <beoran2>	normally you'd go for $199
Jul 05 03:00:42 <Triverske>	I'm feeling generous today
Jul 05 03:00:45 <beoran2>	packaging/labour/adverising/smallprofit
Jul 05 03:01:23 <beoran2>	I think that if the production really reaches mass production level, $150 and even $100 should be attainable...
Jul 05 03:01:49 <beoran2>	but as I saw with OpenPandora, costs usually get underestimated. 
Jul 05 03:02:28 <beoran2>	interestingly enough, a console like th ND would then cost something like
Jul 05 03:02:57 <Triverske>	a lot
Jul 05 03:03:00 <[]J>	:'(
Jul 05 03:03:35 <beoran2>	so already cpu(with PMIC included): $7 + mem: $5 + sound: $2 + screen:$15 + sd: $3.0 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + speakers: $1 + PCB: $10 + plastics: $10 + statics/wiring/screws: $5 + pick/place smt: $10
Jul 05 03:04:02 <beoran2>	74$
Jul 05 03:04:14 <beoran2>	to go down to $50 when mass produced.
Jul 05 03:04:57 <beoran2>	in other words, it's not possible /yet/
Jul 05 03:05:25 <beoran2>	Those cheapo Chinese toys use 16 bits chips with everything (including the games) built in. 
Jul 05 03:05:32 <Giroro>	ps2chipper thought it might be possible at $30
Jul 05 03:05:36 <Giroro>	fwiw
Jul 05 03:05:59 <beoran2>	Giroro: maybe, if the CPU has more things integrated in it
Jul 05 03:06:28 <Giroro>	yeah. maybe there's a good soc out there for this, but probably not
Jul 05 03:06:34 <Triverske>	$179.99 is my target price, it's $50 cheaper than the lowest priced iPod touch
Jul 05 03:07:14 <Triverske>	Also
Jul 05 03:07:21 <Triverske>	I haven't thought of this yet
Jul 05 03:07:30 <Triverske>	but shouldn't this thing have webcams?
Jul 05 03:07:39 <beoran2>	Triverske: well, our oom calculation shows it is possible
Jul 05 03:07:51 <beoran2>	Order of magnitude
Jul 05 03:07:51 <Triverske>	They're definitely cheap
Jul 05 03:08:00 <beoran2>	well, add $1 then for the webcam :)
Jul 05 03:08:08 <Triverske>	make that two
Jul 05 03:08:16 <Triverske>	front and back
Jul 05 03:08:17 <beoran2>	hardware cost will be around $130 then
Jul 05 03:09:08 <Exophase>	Desperately gotta go.. g'night :/
Jul 05 03:09:09 <Giroro>	hell make 2 on the back, and instant 3D pictures. because, you know, gimmicks
Jul 05 03:09:23 <Triverske>	See ya exophase
Jul 05 03:09:32 <beoran2>	https://gist.github.com/1064333 <- Overview of parts and estimated costs here
Jul 05 03:09:32 <Giroro>	cy
Jul 05 03:09:36 <Giroro>	*cya
Jul 05 03:09:42 <beoran2>	Exophase: *cya
Jul 05 03:10:09 <Exophase>	I think nD's memory won't be $5 even
Jul 05 03:10:30 <beoran2>	well, then $2? 
Jul 05 03:10:35 <Exophase>	And like you saw before you can get that SoC with sound instead of say CAN.. but it's more expensive then :<
Jul 05 03:10:54 <Exophase>	Yeah I dunno. Maybe Bob will be a real jerk and make it limited to the SoC's 128KB of on-chip RAM ;)
Jul 05 03:10:56 <beoran2>	sure it is, but it reduced the wiring/pcb cost
Jul 05 03:11:11 <Exophase>	Yeah less components is always a plus on its own..
Jul 05 03:11:23 <beoran2>	also will make pick and place cheaper
Jul 05 03:11:27 <Exophase>	Especially if its size is dominated by package like a codec would be.
Jul 05 03:11:54 <Triverske>	Exophase, do you like the idea of dual webcams?
Jul 05 03:11:55 <Exophase>	I think he'll use discrete NAND too, dunno the cost but I'm sure less than SD if he gets the supplier.
Jul 05 03:12:13 <beoran2>	well, then 
Jul 05 03:12:29 <Exophase>	And the assembly and PCB will definitely be much less for him, PCB costs are based on number of layers and surface area, I think.
Jul 05 03:12:45 <Exophase>	His won't need to be 8 layer, maybe more like 4 layer
Jul 05 03:13:03 <Exophase>	Triverske; I wouldn't want them, but if they're cheap enough I dunno?
Jul 05 03:13:18 <beoran2>	so already cpu(with PMIC/sound included): $10 + mem: $2 + screen:$10 + nand: $2 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + speakers: $1 + PCB: $5 + plastics: $10 + statics/wiring/screws: $5 + pick/place smt: $5
Jul 05 03:13:21 <Triverske>	they're cheap enough
Jul 05 03:13:26 <Exophase>	Less for plastic too (again, surface area, simpler mold maybe?)
Jul 05 03:13:45 <Exophase>	Dunno about display, I have a feeling he'll go for the shittiest he can.. but let me say this, even going to 480x272 is a lot cheaper than 800x480.
Jul 05 03:13:45 <beoran2>	it's not the surface, but the complecity
Jul 05 03:14:08 <beoran2>	ok, let's assube even hceaper then on plastics and screen
Jul 05 03:14:18 <beoran2>	so already cpu(with PMIC/sound included): $10 + mem: $2 + screen:$5 + nand: $2 + battery: $5 + wifi/bt: $1 + speakers: $1 + PCB: $5 + plastics: $5 + statics/wiring/screws: $5 + pick/place smt: $5
Jul 05 03:14:27 <Exophase>	Surface area is certainly at least some contributor since you do have to pay for actual silicon, then actual copper/whatever
Jul 05 03:14:42 <beoran2>	$46
Jul 05 03:14:44 <Exophase>	But it'll be a lot less complex in terms of nets
Jul 05 03:14:55 <Exophase>	For one thing, he'll probably use 16-bit memory
Jul 05 03:15:01 <beoran2>	I mean for the casing it's structural compmexity
Jul 05 03:15:05 <Exophase>	Oh, the casing.
Jul 05 03:15:25 <Exophase>	Yeah, sounds right, although I'm sure the plastic has some unit cost contribution too..
Jul 05 03:15:26 <beoran2>	a 4 lauer PCB costs $5 mass produced
Jul 05 03:15:48 <Exophase>	For Bob I'd say the passives will take up a measurable percentage since he's shooting so low.
Jul 05 03:15:56 <beoran2>	one way to reduce cost is not to have an openable battery hatch
Jul 05 03:16:11 <Exophase>	I agree 100% though, $10? What is he thinking?
Jul 05 03:16:25 <Exophase>	Yeah, he says they'll be so disposible.. may as well..
Jul 05 03:16:26 <beoran2>	Exophase: I doubt he was thinking well.
Jul 05 03:16:43 <Exophase>	I think you only get at the LOWEST end by having really custom consolidated ASICs
Jul 05 03:16:45 <Exophase>	That just do everything.
Jul 05 03:16:45 <beoran2>	there are $15 consoles out there, but they're al hard)-chipped
Jul 05 03:16:53 <Exophase>	Right, exactly
Jul 05 03:16:55 <beoran2>	Exophase: exactly
Jul 05 03:17:09 <beoran2>	and they can't be programmable, then
Jul 05 03:17:27 <Exophase>	Anyway, if he makes a million of them I guess the unit cost will go down, but..
Jul 05 03:17:37 <Triverske>	Well that's that
Jul 05 03:17:43 <beoran2>	sure, he has to start with a prototype
Jul 05 03:17:46 <Exophase>	I mean, the PCB and assembly cost will and he'll get better deals from suppliers..
Jul 05 03:17:51 <beoran2>	sure
Jul 05 03:18:01 <Exophase>	What he needs is investment money.
Jul 05 03:18:07 <Exophase>	And I don't know how he'll convince investors.
Jul 05 03:18:15 <beoran2>	perhaps, but for that, he need s a prototype to show off. :)
Jul 05 03:18:26 <Triverske>	Well we kinda just proved there's no way that would work out 
Jul 05 03:18:33 <Exophase>	If you ask me, the biggest sign of being able to take a first step in something like this is having your own money from somewhere, and that's why I respect Triverske bringing forth $200k
Jul 05 03:18:46 <beoran2>	well, we also proved tha the could build ap rototype for under 100$ for himself.
Jul 05 03:18:58 <Exophase>	beoran2; Yeah, to do a REAL prototype he'd need at least in the several thousand.
Jul 05 03:19:14 <Exophase>	Or a few thousand anyway.
Jul 05 03:19:14 <beoran2>	Triverske: you /have/ $200k???
Jul 05 03:19:43 <Triverske>	I have more than that
Jul 05 03:19:57 <Triverske>	that's about a 5th of my income though
Jul 05 03:19:58 <Exophase>	beoran2; Do you want to invest in this project too? ;p
Jul 05 03:20:08 <Exophase>	A fifth of your annual income?!
Jul 05 03:20:17 <Exophase>	Like, you personally? Or your shop's, or what?
Jul 05 03:20:23 <beoran2>	What jod do you do, and hwo can I get into it? :)
Jul 05 03:20:30 <Triverske>	Me, personally....
Jul 05 03:20:42 <Exophase>	Man, you're loaded.
Jul 05 03:20:44 <Exophase>	How old are you?
Jul 05 03:20:57 <beoran2>	I doubt you're a programmer? Or are you in facebook? 
Jul 05 03:20:57 <Triverske>	23
Jul 05 03:21:02 <Exophase>	Good god.
Jul 05 03:21:09 <beoran2>	How did you do it? 
Jul 05 03:21:10 <Exophase>	You really hit the jackpot.
Jul 05 03:21:23 <Exophase>	beoran2; Fixing phones and selling phone peripherals.
Jul 05 03:21:31 <Triverske>	Stocks as well
Jul 05 03:21:37 <beoran2>	really? 
Jul 05 03:21:44 <Exophase>	Nice, you must know the market.
Jul 05 03:21:44 <beoran2>	you had a shop
Jul 05 03:21:54 <Exophase>	He has a brick and mortar shop, no less.
Jul 05 03:22:01 <beoran2>	any stock market tips there? 
Jul 05 03:22:07 <Triverske>	Quite a few
Jul 05 03:22:11 <Exophase>	Do you have a degree? Can't imagine you had time to build that business and go to college..
Jul 05 03:22:33 <Triverske>	I take online stuff
Jul 05 03:22:45 <Exophase>	Anyway I didn't know you had so much.. any amount I could offer in investments would be insulting in comparison..
Jul 05 03:22:55 <beoran2>	Goes to show my country gets it all wrong: in my country you /must have/ a degree to be allowed to start your own company.
Jul 05 03:23:28 <Exophase>	I would say making it big without a degree is more the exception than the norm.
Jul 05 03:23:33 <Triverske>	I'm trying to get out of what I'm doing now though
Jul 05 03:23:43 <beoran2>	why? bored? 
Jul 05 03:23:44 <Exophase>	I mean, anyone who happens to hit the market right can make it big..
Jul 05 03:23:51 <beoran2>	or the warket is going sour?
Jul 05 03:23:57 <Exophase>	beoran2; He'd rather sell handhelds ;)
Jul 05 03:24:10 <Triverske>	Next year they'll be triple the amount of businesses that do what I do
Jul 05 03:24:41 <beoran2>	Exophase: in my country, the government really weighs heavily on having your own company. I tried it but the taxes kwere killing me. 
Jul 05 03:24:56 <beoran2>	Triverske: ah, so the market will get flodded. 
Jul 05 03:25:19 <Triverske>	Yes, I entered at the right time, and now I have to get out of it
Jul 05 03:25:30 <beoran2>	it's inevitable. The market, when left alone, will go to break even status in the long run. 
Jul 05 03:25:34 <Exophase>	One other thing before I finally go to bed..
Jul 05 03:25:56 <Exophase>	It's probably best to be conservative with pricing rather than too aggressive from the start, because the worst thing you can do is have to raise the price like Pandora has to now.
Jul 05 03:26:02 <beoran2>	Triverske: is this the USA or the UK, or?
Jul 05 03:26:06 <Exophase>	I'm really surprised that community is taking it as well as they are.
Jul 05 03:26:12 <beoran2>	Exophase: sure
Jul 05 03:26:16 <Exophase>	G'night
Jul 05 03:26:18 <Triverske>	USA
Jul 05 03:26:21 <Triverske>	The nD?
Jul 05 03:26:24 <Triverske>	or what
Jul 05 03:26:32 <beoran2>	my guesttimate was quite conservative, so I'd reccomend stating around $200
Jul 05 03:26:42 <Exophase>	Oh man, could you imagine if Bob took nD preorders for $10
Jul 05 03:26:46 <Exophase>	That'd be quite the debacle..
Jul 05 03:26:48 <Exophase>	G'night >_>
Jul 05 03:26:50 <Triverske>	nite
Jul 05 03:27:01 <beoran2>	I think Exophase means your handheld, Triverske 
Jul 05 03:27:19 <Triverske>	I would hope it gets a positive reaction
Jul 05 03:28:05 <beoran2>	Triverske: first you'll have to psition yourself agains tthe pandora nad agains the commercial consoles. 
Jul 05 03:28:22 <beoran2>	against the pandora: cheaper, purely for games. 
Jul 05 03:28:56 <beoran2>	against the other handhelds: cheaper for developers to develop for, cheaper games
Jul 05 03:29:23 <Triverske>	The biggest problem I see arising is Vita getting hacked and homebrew within a year of release
Jul 05 03:29:47 <beoran2>	Vita, that is the name? 
Jul 05 03:29:56 <Giroro>	yes
Jul 05 03:30:13 <beoran2>	the thing to remember is: you cannot stop the hackers
Jul 05 03:30:13 <Triverske>	that's the new PSP
Jul 05 03:30:26 <[]J>	how hard is it to pirate android stuff?
Jul 05 03:30:44 <beoran2>	but with haclers i mean: prohgrammers
Jul 05 03:30:53 <Triverske>	J: I dunno, but that won't be my problem
Jul 05 03:30:55 <beoran2>	not those who make piracy
Jul 05 03:31:05 <[]J>	ohh
Jul 05 03:31:16 <Triverske>	I've already named my portable
Jul 05 03:31:16 <beoran2>	you see, most devices get cracked because programmers want to homebrew on their toys
Jul 05 03:31:44 <beoran2>	then the pirates use the explits of the programmers to distibute piracy
Jul 05 03:32:13 <beoran2>	to avoid this, the PS3 ahd the right idea in the beginning: it allowed Linux to be run. Only when they removed this, the console was cracked. 
Jul 05 03:32:25 <Triverske>	mhmm
Jul 05 03:32:37 <beoran2>	in other words: don' t fear the homebrewers, make them your allies
Jul 05 03:32:44 <beoran2>	and the pirates won't stand a chance
Jul 05 03:33:23 <Triverske>	Indeed
Jul 05 03:33:30 <beoran2>	I wouldn't use Android as your OS, though. 
Jul 05 03:33:42 <Triverske>	it's going to dual-boot
Jul 05 03:34:14 ---	Triverske is now known as Tri[sleeping][PM_me]
Jul 05 03:34:18 <beoran2>	Triverske: hmmm... that sounds complicated for a gaming device. :)
Jul 05 03:34:24 <Tri[sleeping][PM_me]>	Well
Jul 05 03:34:32 <Tri[sleeping][PM_me]>	it's something new
Jul 05 03:35:24 <beoran2>	it is... but I'd go for a custom Linux 
Jul 05 03:36:12 <beoran2>	that can also run android apps
Jul 05 03:37:59 <beoran2>	any way, good night to you

Jul 05 10:57:17 <Kutagh>	GTA4
Jul 05 10:57:18 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 05 10:57:29 <Triverske>	Such a good game
Jul 05 10:58:14 <Triverske>	I'm going to go play it

Jul 05 12:12:45 <Kutagh>	newb traeak 
Jul 05 12:21:03 <traeak>	newb ?
Jul 05 12:21:20 <traeak>	caught up on what triverske was doing
Jul 05 12:21:28 <traeak>	and the hardare costs for what bob is doing
Jul 05 12:22:02 <traeak>	i have to agree, unless bob can command a dedicated factory himself that doesn't care aboutr profits, he's full of $%#!
Jul 05 12:22:58 <traeak>	and triverske needs to be careful and not play inthe same league as vita, etc
Jul 05 12:23:07 <traeak>	over $150 he'll end up with another canoo/wiz/etc
Jul 05 12:23:32 <Kutagh>	lol
Jul 05 12:25:29 <traeak>	i certainly like the rough design of the nD stuff...quality buttons are a must
Jul 05 12:26:19 <traeak>	i don't get video out on a handheld gaming system
Jul 05 12:27:21 <[]J>	what
Jul 05 12:27:50 <Kutagh>	nice thing bout video out is big screen....
Jul 05 12:27:52 <traeak>	it's the business model that's being tapped.  The handheld is to exploit the untapped indy market and perhaps pull along other studios...so make the thing about gaming, that's it
Jul 05 12:28:01 <Kutagh>	but stretching 320x240 --> 1920x1080?
Jul 05 12:28:15 <traeak>	i guess, except only a few percent of users if that will even use video out
Jul 05 12:28:32 <traeak>	it's a gimmick...focus first on the core, which is handheld gaming
Jul 05 12:28:41 <traeak>	if the market develops then
Jul 05 12:28:58 <traeak>	pull and apple and release an "extreme" version with all that extra crap
Jul 05 12:29:08 <traeak>	pull AN apple, sry
Jul 05 12:30:01 <traeak>	interesting at deal extreme
Jul 05 12:30:28 <traeak>	it seems the price on the cheapy handheld gaming stuff has dropped in general
Jul 05 12:38:09 <traeak>	i'm also not really convinced full 3d is really necessary either
Jul 05 12:38:13 <traeak>	playing pocket legends
Jul 05 12:38:23 <traeak>	i'd be more than happy to have a fixed camera
Jul 05 12:38:38 <traeak>	in fact it wouldn't detract one bit from the experience IMHO

Jul 05 12:39:14 <traeak>	unless the price difference is that little
Jul 05 12:39:58 <Triverske>	And back
Jul 05 12:40:06 <Triverske>	GTA4 is still fun
Jul 05 12:42:16 <AkumaStreak>	I want something diff. for GTA 5
Jul 05 12:42:24 <AkumaStreak>	Prob. dreaming though
Jul 05 12:42:33 <Triverske>	How much different?
Jul 05 12:43:50 <traeak>	heh
Jul 05 12:44:00 <AkumaStreak>	http://www.evilavatar.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2013462&postcount=24
Jul 05 12:44:07 <traeak>	triverske, congrats on finding and exploiting a market
Jul 05 12:44:25 <traeak>	repeating success is damn difficult
Jul 05 12:45:19 <Triverske>	I was extremely lucky
Jul 05 12:45:27 <Triverske>	and that's all I have to say about that
Jul 05 12:45:36 <RobinJ>	does anyone actually have any idea when the nD would be released?
Jul 05 12:46:01 <Triverske>	Robin, the nD will probably have a 2012 release date
Jul 05 12:46:30 <RobinJ>	i read on the forums that you have to take something called "bob time" into account? xD
Jul 05 12:47:07 <Triverske>	Yes, bob time is normal time times 7 divided by two times 1.03
Jul 05 12:47:35 <Triverske>	It also changes
Jul 05 12:47:44 <Triverske>	depending on the day of the week
Jul 05 12:47:50 <RobinJ>	hmm xd
Jul 05 12:47:59 <traeak>	triverske: lots of stuff has to go right
Jul 05 12:48:16 <RobinJ>	so it will take about 3 and a half year? :p
Jul 05 12:48:24 <RobinJ>	well, thats 2015 xd
Jul 05 12:48:36 <Triverske>	It will be before that
Jul 05 12:48:43 <RobinJ>	:p
Jul 05 12:48:50 <Triverske>	2012 is my best bet
Jul 05 12:48:53 <traeak>	so you want to move forward with a $179.99 console triverske ?
Jul 05 12:48:54 <RobinJ>	the concept is really good, now let's hoep it gets finished :p
Jul 05 12:49:14 <Triverske>	Yes Traeak
Jul 05 12:49:48 <RobinJ>	Triverske: Have you already made progress with DOOMnD or are you also waiting until it's been released?
Jul 05 12:49:49 <RobinJ>	:p
Jul 05 12:50:18 <Triverske>	DOOMnD will be released the day the console is released
Jul 05 12:50:32 <traeak>	Triverske: at that price you're at the same level as the more open android tablets, that's a dangerous place to be
Jul 05 12:50:46 <traeak>	Triverske: more open than the current handheld market i mean
Jul 05 12:50:52 <RobinJ>	huh, so you've already made progress? :o nice
Jul 05 12:51:02 <traeak>	Triverske: and also people who are spending that much to get a phone + phone plan
Jul 05 12:51:18 <Triverske>	Traeak, I'll PM you
Jul 05 12:51:26 <RobinJ>	having doom on the nD already makes the device worth the money :p
Jul 05 12:52:34 <Triverske>	I agree, DOOM is just an excellent game
Jul 05 12:52:57 <RobinJ>	i've never played the origininal DOOM though, only FreeDOOM
Jul 05 12:53:24 <AkumaStreak>	traeak weren't we talking about a console the other day?
Jul 05 12:54:01 <traeak>	AkumaStreak: handheld, yeah
Jul 05 12:54:20 <AkumaStreak>	lol, you're busy
Jul 05 12:54:35 <AkumaStreak>	and it was only handheld after you talked me into it :-P
Jul 05 12:59:28 <RobinJ>	<Triverske> DOOMnD will be released the day the console is released << but how will you know? as the release date for the nD isnt even set :p
Jul 05 12:59:48 <RobinJ>	how are you going to work to a deadline you don't know yourself? :p
Jul 05 13:00:35 <Triverske>	It's already done
Jul 05 13:01:00 <RobinJ>	HUH
Jul 05 13:01:15 <RobinJ>	and how do you know it works? :|
Jul 05 13:01:25 <RobinJ>	on the devixce itself i mean
Jul 05 13:02:16 <Triverske>	Well, I won't be able to fully test it until the SDK comes out, but I have the code ready
Jul 05 13:05:58 <traeak>	what type of sdk are you shooting for?
Jul 05 13:07:18 <Triverske>	Well "bob" has to release a SDK that's specific for the nD
Jul 05 13:09:21 <traeak>	how good/bad would it be to use android as a jumping off point?
Jul 05 13:10:31 <Triverske>	Android is okay, I'm personally using the GP2X
Jul 05 13:12:18 <RobinJ>	so it currently runs on a PC?

Jul 05 15:02:34 <ps2chiper>	honestly i think their are two many zombie movies and video games coming out these days
Jul 05 15:02:51 <ps2chiper>	kind of taking away the mystic of it
Jul 05 15:02:53 <Kutagh>	ps2chiper, I rather think there are too many realistic games coming out nowdays
Jul 05 15:03:09 <Kutagh>	and proper zombie games are not that often released
Jul 05 15:03:17 <emusan>	I think there are too many shit games coming out these days
Jul 05 15:03:20 <Kutagh>	just as often as a wild west game I think
Jul 05 15:03:20 <ps2chiper>	yeah proper ones

Jul 05 15:10:34 <beoran3>	I usually prefer RPG's or action/adventure.  
Jul 05 15:10:52 <ps2chiper>	I like a game with a good story
Jul 05 15:10:54 <AkumaStreak>	Those were largely considered adventure games
Jul 05 15:11:16 <AkumaStreak>	I prefer games with realistic tit physics
Jul 05 15:11:37 <beoran3>	ps2chiper: agreed there, I like an interesting story too, combined with fun gameplay: 3A game is a series of interesting choices"

Jul 05 15:13:20 <AkumaStreak>	word
Jul 05 15:15:48 <beoran3>	someho I remember this Final Fantasy ii(us) ad: on page 1 mog the moogle  surrounded by monsters : Doesn't look fair, does it? 
Jul 05 15:16:25 <beoran3>	then turn over the the next page: mog surounded by ashheap, leaning in a sword. : "Who says life is fair?" 
Jul 05 15:17:54 <beoran3>	fairness does not exist in nature, it is something we have to make ourselves.

Jul 05 15:22:40 <AkumaStreak>	does it really matter if it will ever exist
Jul 05 15:22:42 <ps2chiper>	yeah
Jul 05 15:22:43 <Kutagh>	as well as basically saying "I don't care about developers"
Jul 05 15:23:30 <Kutagh>	and AkumaStreak couple of us here actually were contemplating doing our own version of the nD if the nD is a hoax (or bob is a fail)
Jul 05 15:23:42 <ps2chiper>	he also could of taken something like dingux and rebranded it for him self
Jul 05 15:23:45 <Kutagh>	so I think that we are indeed quite interested in the nD :p
Jul 05 15:23:59 <AkumaStreak>	yeah traeak got me going the other day
Jul 05 15:24:23 <AkumaStreak>	we need some fucking hardware hackers
Jul 05 15:24:33 <AkumaStreak>	i am not sold on this idea of general-purpose hardware for everythign
Jul 05 15:24:59 <Kutagh>	well, using generic hardware generally means lower costs.
Jul 05 15:25:08 <AkumaStreak>	yeah prob.
Jul 05 15:25:11 <AkumaStreak>	up front
Jul 05 15:25:15 <Kutagh>	and if price is crucial it is definitely worth looking into
Jul 05 15:25:24 <AkumaStreak>	also makes it more realistic for small shops
Jul 05 15:25:36 <ps2chiper>	the real problem is that nobody on irc has any eda skills
Jul 05 15:25:48 <AkumaStreak>	de-acronym please
Jul 05 15:26:21 <ps2chiper>	I can manufacture hardware pretty easily, but I don't have the patients to learn eda
Jul 05 15:26:28 <AkumaStreak>	which is what
Jul 05 15:26:41 <AkumaStreak>	gonna make me google eh
Jul 05 15:26:44 <ps2chiper>	what is what?

Jul 05 15:27:41 <ps2chiper>	You have to be near autistic to like it
Jul 05 15:27:58 <AkumaStreak>	i might be able to pull it off
Jul 05 15:28:04 <AkumaStreak>	i can spend forever on programming tasks
Jul 05 15:28:16 <AkumaStreak>	can spend weeks doing same thing

Jul 05 15:28:35 <ps2chiper>	I dont like spending a lot of time doing the same thing
Jul 05 15:29:46 <Triverske>	Me neither, but it gets me money
Jul 05 15:29:54 <AkumaStreak>	i almost feel like nintendo is the only company making the kind of hardware i am talking about still and they are prob. nearly done doing that
Jul 05 15:30:24 <ps2chiper>	they have enough chinese junk out there that can match the ds specs
Jul 05 15:30:31 <ps2chiper>	its just their is no software to compete
Jul 05 15:30:43 <AkumaStreak>	i am not interested in ds specs anymore honestly
Jul 05 15:30:54 <AkumaStreak>	like i told traeak the other day
Jul 05 15:30:58 <ps2chiper>	well the nD was for 2d gaming
Jul 05 15:31:04 <AkumaStreak>	i want a perfect 2d console
Jul 05 15:31:06 <AkumaStreak>	aka nothing it can't do
Jul 05 15:31:17 <AkumaStreak>	because 2d is essentially "figured out"
Jul 05 15:31:30 <AkumaStreak>	no reason there shouldn't be a dedicated console that has zero limitations in that dept.
Jul 05 15:31:44 <AkumaStreak>	1080P massive sprites no prob
Jul 05 15:31:55 <AkumaStreak>	ridiculous sprite counts
Jul 05 15:31:58 <AkumaStreak>	tons of memory
Jul 05 15:32:01 <ps2chiper>	another issue is people dont realize how insanely hard it can be to manufacture something
Jul 05 15:32:03 <AkumaStreak>	giant HDD
Jul 05 15:32:03 <AkumaStreak>	etc.
Jul 05 15:32:04 <AkumaStreak>	lol
Jul 05 15:32:08 <AkumaStreak>	i know it's hard
Jul 05 15:32:10 <AkumaStreak>	but i like hobbies
Jul 05 15:32:12 <AkumaStreak>	:-)
Jul 05 15:32:17 <traeak>	what you want and what the market wants :-p
Jul 05 15:32:30 <AkumaStreak>	oh i've no idea if the market wants that
Jul 05 15:32:51 <ps2chiper>	chinese just wait for an order, and try to cut corners around the specs
Jul 05 15:33:28 <ps2chiper>	they dont have that inventive spirit in their schools, at the same time, you dont have that manufacturing spirit in your schools
Jul 05 15:33:32 <traeak>	ps2chiper: it's a shame aobut the chinese companies.  I know they prefer doing business with US customers because they can trust US companies, but they still try to screw them
Jul 05 15:33:45 <ps2chiper>	no thats not true
Jul 05 15:33:52 <AkumaStreak>	so the chinese comps are bad?
Jul 05 15:33:54 <AkumaStreak>	the way i see it
Jul 05 15:33:59 <AkumaStreak>	they are filling a void the US isn't atm
Jul 05 15:34:01 <ps2chiper>	they prefer middle east and african business more
Jul 05 15:34:04 <traeak>	pretty interesting the wierdness with the chinese...if they won't fix the integrety issues
Jul 05 15:34:04 <AkumaStreak>	and that is a fault with the US
Jul 05 15:34:25 <Kutagh>	lol I saw on alibaba chinese companies advertising with microSD cards of 128MB that show up as 2GB ones...
Jul 05 15:34:44 <traeak>	my wife used to work as an auditor for the international companies that were set up in shanghai
Jul 05 15:34:52 <Kutagh>	That is literally what they advertised
Jul 05 15:35:01 <ps2chiper>	remember I worked for the past 4 years in shenzhen
Jul 05 15:35:09 <traeak>	yup, different environments
Jul 05 15:35:25 <beoran3>	AkumaStreak: the problem with very high resolution 2D games is that it takes ages and ages to hand-draw suc hhuge sprites.
Jul 05 15:36:12 <AkumaStreak>	yeah i will give you that
Jul 05 15:36:14 <AkumaStreak>	110%
Jul 05 15:36:31 <AkumaStreak>	basically i would like a dedicated console however that can push it if someone wants to make it
Jul 05 15:36:33 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, I want to see you design a 1080p handheld... :p
Jul 05 15:36:38 <AkumaStreak>	most won't because of that challenge
Jul 05 15:37:09 <traeak>	and no thx for squinting (could be problem for the 2.4" display)
Jul 05 15:37:10 <AkumaStreak>	i think integrated development tools and democratic game sharing etc. would be just as big as the hardware for such a platform tho
Jul 05 15:37:25 <AkumaStreak>	i liked the idea traeak and i were tlaking about the other day
Jul 05 15:37:35 <traeak>	if i can remmeber :-p
Jul 05 15:37:36 <AkumaStreak>	widescreen portable with DPI closest to 640x480
Jul 05 15:37:48 <AkumaStreak>	but that can spit out 1080P games tv-out no prob
Jul 05 15:37:50 <traeak>	was i involved in that?  hehe
Jul 05 15:37:56 <AkumaStreak>	so the game developer basically chooses what mode to ship the game as
Jul 05 15:37:59 <beoran3>	No thatwas with me, i think.
Jul 05 15:38:04 <AkumaStreak>	low-res can be played on the game
Jul 05 15:38:08 <AkumaStreak>	err on the go i mean
Jul 05 15:38:09 <traeak>	i believe so beoran
Jul 05 15:38:10 <AkumaStreak>	or on the tele
Jul 05 15:38:13 <AkumaStreak>	but if you want high-res
Jul 05 15:38:17 <AkumaStreak>	need 1080P tele
Jul 05 15:38:26 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, good devs would actually provide an ingame switch for that :p
Jul 05 15:38:34 <Kutagh>	or if possible firmware based one
Jul 05 15:38:38 <AkumaStreak>	well whoever it was. :-) i can't keep track of people initially whenever i start autojoining a new chan
Jul 05 15:38:47 <AkumaStreak>	good devs huh
Jul 05 15:38:49 <Kutagh>	#if TV_OUT
Jul 05 15:38:54 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 05 15:38:58 <AkumaStreak>	i considered that but considered that it might be an annoyance
Jul 05 15:39:05 <AkumaStreak>	would rather just have a flag for whole title.
Jul 05 15:39:22 <AkumaStreak>	good devs wouldn't implement it as "#If TV_OUT"
Jul 05 15:39:24 <AkumaStreak>	:-P
Jul 05 15:39:33 <Kutagh>	was just being very pseudo-codey
Jul 05 15:39:39 <Kutagh>	so you'd have to close the game, start the other one...
Jul 05 15:39:43 <Kutagh>	just to switch modes?
Jul 05 15:39:45 <AkumaStreak>	i kinda like per-title mode glad
Jul 05 15:39:46 <AkumaStreak>	err flag
Jul 05 15:39:51 <beoran3>	AkumaStreak: I've also been developin gan idea for another powerful handgeld with Triverske 
Jul 05 15:39:53 <AkumaStreak>	so that low-res titles have a consistent look
Jul 05 15:39:54 <Kutagh>	I'd just get annoyed at that :p
Jul 05 15:40:01 <beoran3>	togethe rwith others
Jul 05 15:40:02 <AkumaStreak>	and so people aren't trying to play some of it on the tele
Jul 05 15:40:04 <AkumaStreak>	and some on the go
Jul 05 15:40:04 <AkumaStreak>	etc.
Jul 05 15:40:25 <beoran3>	Triverske's handheld can do 3D , so it can emulate Nintendo64.
Jul 05 15:40:29 <AkumaStreak>	the GBA was similar
Jul 05 15:40:35 <AkumaStreak>	you could choose from around 3 video modes
Jul 05 15:40:53 <Kutagh>	you know how old the GBA is? ;)
Jul 05 15:40:54 <AkumaStreak>	similar also to VGA dos days were some modes had positives and negatives.
Jul 05 15:41:18 <beoran3>	DOS+DJGPP was neat yeah
Jul 05 15:41:22 <AkumaStreak>	not sure what your point is
Jul 05 15:41:26 <AkumaStreak>	we are retro fans obviously
Jul 05 15:41:30 <beoran3>	The OS would sta ot of your way
Jul 05 15:41:38 <traeak>	Triverske *may* have a good business model.  His risk is that he may end up falling in the wiz/canoo trap
Jul 05 15:41:49 <traeak>	but gamepark really screwed themselves more than anything else
Jul 05 15:42:05 <beoran3>	traeak: how so? 
Jul 05 15:42:19 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, my point being that now we're talking about a different time, different hardware/software solutions
Jul 05 15:42:25 <Kutagh>	what was good 10 years ago
Jul 05 15:42:33 <Kutagh>	might be bad nowadays
Jul 05 15:43:03 <traeak>	beoran3: selling console for $179 ... cost wise that competes with ninty/sony/etc and if one of those consoles gets hacked they will steal the developer mindshare
Jul 05 15:43:10 <AkumaStreak>	I am a fan of consistency and I just though personally a per-title resolution choice would be better than having games change mode during execution. For consistency and simplicity.
Jul 05 15:43:26 <AkumaStreak>	Also I hated things like old 3D cards that would change mode all the time.
Jul 05 15:43:38 <beoran3>	traeak: thats' why it's important to be open for homebrew
Jul 05 15:43:39 <Kutagh>	Honestly, doesn't have to be immediately changed
Jul 05 15:43:56 <Kutagh>	If they can detect the change they could just use a pop-up question box
Jul 05 15:44:05 <AkumaStreak>	A pop-up question box!?
Jul 05 15:44:08 <AkumaStreak>	For what.
Jul 05 15:44:09 <Kutagh>	TV-out signal detected. Do you want to switch to 1080p?
Jul 05 15:44:11 <traeak>	beoran3:  and definitely the mistake gamepark made...not offering a stable software base
Jul 05 15:44:13 <Kutagh>	Yes/No
Jul 05 15:44:13 <AkumaStreak>	Now I am wondering if you are just baiting me.
Jul 05 15:44:27 <beoran3>	traeak: that's important, yes
Jul 05 15:44:27 <AkumaStreak>	You don't design the kind of games and system I am talking about to support games at different resolutions.
Jul 05 15:44:37 <ps2chiper>	did anyone call the phone number registered to the domain?  +1.2139471032
Jul 05 15:44:57 <Kutagh>	Then honestly, I miss the consistency there.
Jul 05 15:44:59 <Kutagh>	>.>
Jul 05 15:45:05 <beoran3>	traeak: I'd go for an SDK based on SDL and lua simply because that's portable and widely used. The OS is a secondary matter.
Jul 05 15:45:27 <Kutagh>	If I get a game for a handheld, I expect it to be able to play it on the handheld.
Jul 05 15:45:34 <traeak>	ps2chiper: why does china/s korea have such a problem developing stable firmware/software ?
Jul 05 15:45:49 <Kutagh>	And not only on a 1080p screen because the developer thought the small screen sucked.
Jul 05 15:46:03 <ps2chiper>	because customers dont give a shit if it works as long as it sells
Jul 05 15:46:03 <traeak>	beoran3: except lots of ppl bitch about SDL, i guess take with a grain of salt anyways
Jul 05 15:46:35 <beoran3>	traeak: maybe, but it's very portable s an API
Jul 05 15:46:46 <beoran3>	otherwiser, Allegro :) 
Jul 05 15:47:04 <beoran3>	thats' a classic API tha thas sprang back to life
Jul 05 15:47:55 <traeak>	ps2chiper: that may work in asia but doesn't seem to fly in NA/europe
Jul 05 15:48:09 <ps2chiper>	it sure does
Jul 05 15:48:16 <ps2chiper>	look how shitty android was
Jul 05 15:48:31 <beoran3>	well, now it's getting better
Jul 05 15:48:44 <ps2chiper>	yes, but when it first came out, it was real buggy
Jul 05 15:48:49 <ps2chiper>	look at boxee box
Jul 05 15:48:51 <traeak>	android was backed appropriately and had a roadplan
Jul 05 15:48:55 <beoran3>	my wife has a 150€ android pone and I was amazed by the flexibility of it
Jul 05 15:49:09 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: So would you rather have a stationary console that is 1080P only for television or one that because of the fact that you could miniaturize it and take it on the go to play lower-resolution games allows that
Jul 05 15:49:10 <traeak>	the stuff out of asia is throwaway junk for now
Jul 05 15:49:17 <AkumaStreak>	Asking in all seriousness as I am curious
Jul 05 15:49:18 <ps2chiper>	im talking 2007/8 android
Jul 05 15:49:37 <beoran3>	ps2chiper: sure, these things take time to be developed. 
Jul 05 15:49:44 <traeak>	committment to android
Jul 05 15:49:49 <ps2chiper>	honestly they dont value software
Jul 05 15:50:03 <beoran3>	it's the "release early release often" mantra 
Jul 05 15:50:13 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, I'd rather have not the 1080p mode at all and have a handheld instead.
Jul 05 15:50:16 <traeak>	ps2chiper: i was just asking if it's something cultural in china as to why those numerous chinese manufacturers don't try to create a more substantial market
Jul 05 15:50:34 <ps2chiper>	I can give you the jack campbell email he gave me
Jul 05 15:50:36 <beoran3>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often
Jul 05 15:50:57 <Kutagh>	Which is my point: I'm expecting a handheld, if games don't work when not hooked up to a TV, honestly I wouldn't call it a handheld anymore. 
Jul 05 15:50:58 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: That makes sense, but there are many fans of some of the newer high-resolution 2D games ala Guilty Gear etc.
Jul 05 15:51:04 <ps2chiper>	Jason,
Jul 05 15:51:05 <ps2chiper>	Your contact has re-opened a whole set of issues with which I had to cope when turning around Tsinghua Tongfang's OEM/ODM consumer electronics operations in 2006—2008. The factors I faced then have only continued to move along in the same directions I was seeing at that time.
Jul 05 15:51:05 <ps2chiper>	Basically, the whole OEM/ODM business model that successfully scaled the China electronics manufacturing sector from the early 90's until recently has broken down. The old tried and true method was to create a catalog of pre-engineered product platforms based on Asian SoC vendor BSPs, show these to The West, and build customized versions for OEM/ODM buyers here. The whole iPod/MP3/MP4 player spike from 2001 to 2007 fueled that system even furt
Jul 05 15:51:06 <ps2chiper>	her...
Jul 05 15:51:08 <ps2chiper>	Now, all the profits in this method have long since been distilled away, as thousands of China companies have been chasing the same finite pool of possible customers with an ever growing sea of similar products. The whole MP3/MP4/MID/STB/IPTV product range has collapsed in both channel demand and pricing — leaving thousands of small OEM factories like yours asking the same questions: What's next? Where do we go from here?
Jul 05 15:51:15 <ps2chiper>	At it's core this is a problem of central planning in the China government. Incentives and structural supports needed put into place at least five years ago to incentivize factories to enter the Western market with own-brand products. University tracks needed fostered for industrial design, OS-level and app-level software development, marketing, and brand management, with an emphasis on Western market awareness and techniques. It didn't happen
Jul 05 15:51:20 <ps2chiper>	. So now, these skills are in horribly short supply, leaving these factories still dependent upon SoC makers (for the most part) for the technology platforms, and with no capabilities to launch and sustain direct Western-market sales of their own branded products.
Jul 05 15:51:24 <ps2chiper>	The skills needed aren't there. The financial risk-taking mentality has not been cultured. And, the profits have completely disappeared from the existing business mode
Jul 05 15:52:10 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: I hear what you're saying, but it goes against the idea of a system that can meet everyone's 2D desires
Jul 05 15:52:20 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: (if it has to be 2 systems)
Jul 05 15:52:50 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, my opinion is that the 1080p mode should be an add-on rather than being a whole separate mode
Jul 05 15:52:55 <beoran3>	ps2chiper: what is an indiation for me is the amount of programming languages designed. 
Jul 05 15:53:23 <ps2chiper>	Come again, beoran3?
Jul 05 15:53:25 <beoran3>	The US is producig oodles of programming la,nguages, europe a fzew, japan and chine, each only one. 
Jul 05 15:53:32 <Kutagh>	otherwise I think it might actually be a waste of doing the handheld part tbh
Jul 05 15:53:44 <beoran3>	ps2chiper: yes, programming languages, like c, Ruby, python, etc,
Jul 05 15:53:44 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: Yea, I am very against add-on hardware in concept. 32X and Sega CD I don't remember fondly
Jul 05 15:53:49 <AkumaStreak>	but interesting idea
Jul 05 15:54:01 <ps2chiper>	honestly, i think just what ever they teach in the local colleges
Jul 05 15:54:18 <traeak>	ps2chiper: thx for that explanation.  it makes perfect sense and to some degree follows the japanese collapse in their electronics industry.  It seems that when government gets heavily involved it "freezes" the industry it's trying to stimulate so it does really well until the market changes...and the company isn't incentivized to follow the market
Jul 05 15:54:20 <beoran3>	ps2chiper: I mean, in which country was the language invented
Jul 05 15:54:24 <ps2chiper>	its all windows based crap too. so just c++/c# and asp
Jul 05 15:54:34 <beoran3>	python is from the netherlands, ruby from japan, C from the USA.
Jul 05 15:54:37 <Kutagh>	Thing is, if you market it as a handheld, it should be able to play every game for the handheld on the fly.
Jul 05 15:54:45 <beoran3>	and you can see it :)
Jul 05 15:55:16 <Kutagh>	Giving most games the added bonus of 1080p mode on TV-out would help in marketing and appeal to a wider market
Jul 05 15:55:19 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: Not sure. I see your point. I was thinking console only but then I was talked into the idea of handheld as the hardware could prob. easily fit into handheld form factor.
Jul 05 15:55:24 <ps2chiper>	I never investigated the origins of computer languages that heavily 
Jul 05 15:55:33 <beoran3>	c++ : Danish
Jul 05 15:55:54 <AkumaStreak>	I think it would be possible to package games in 2 very different ways. One clearly for portable use and one for stationary console use.
Jul 05 15:55:56 <beoran3>	I'm 100% convinced tha tthe culture of the maker influences the proramming language
Jul 05 15:55:57 <Kutagh>	Also AkumaStreak what keeps developers from just not bothering with a handheld version and just do the 1080p version?
Jul 05 15:56:13 <AkumaStreak>	Either way... the titles for a system like this imo would most likely not have a cartridge form despite the nostalgic appeal.
Jul 05 15:56:14 <ps2chiper>	making a stationary console is very easy
Jul 05 15:56:18 <Kutagh>	if a significant majority does that, then what is the point of the handheld part
Jul 05 15:56:39 <AkumaStreak>	Kutagh: They can, that's the point
Jul 05 15:56:47 <AkumaStreak>	They can do what the want
Jul 05 15:57:02 -->	Giroro_ (~Giroro@synIRC-8F674A4F.hsd1.ut.comcast.net) has joined #nD
Jul 05 15:57:11 <Kutagh>	My point is: if 90% does that...
Jul 05 15:57:20 <Kutagh>	Then why bother even calling it a handheld
Jul 05 15:57:21 <AkumaStreak>	The portable-spec'ed titles could run on the tele too
Jul 05 15:57:24 <--	Giroro has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 05 15:57:25 <AkumaStreak>	but not the other way
Jul 05 15:57:28 <Kutagh>	as most games aren't available on the fly
Jul 05 15:57:36 <AkumaStreak>	I don't think 90% would
Jul 05 15:57:44 <AkumaStreak>	90% would choose the mode that works wherever
Jul 05 15:57:55 <AkumaStreak>	but the point is that if someone wanted to make a Guily Gear quality game in the visual dept.
Jul 05 15:57:56 <AkumaStreak>	they could
Jul 05 15:58:00 <Kutagh>	Your handheld, your choices
Jul 05 15:58:06 <beoran3>	C: the free american spirit. C+++: danish small minded ness trying to limit that freedom. Python: the dutch love ordely and simple structures and designs. Ruby: user friendly to a fault, but a bit crazy like the Japanese. 
Jul 05 15:58:08 <Kutagh>	Let's keep it at that
Jul 05 15:58:28 <AkumaStreak>	Just brainstorming and all that. As others pointed out those kind of games are hard to make, they would be in the minority.
Jul 05 15:58:39 <AkumaStreak>	I am a fan of stationary consoles personally anyway.
Jul 05 15:58:49 <AkumaStreak>	But consumers seem to love their mobile devices.
Jul 05 15:59:33 <ps2chiper>	I guess the same reason they like facebook
Jul 05 15:59:45 <ps2chiper>	to make one persons self esteem higher
Jul 05 15:59:51 <AkumaStreak>	? heh
Jul 05 16:00:00 <beoran3>	it's amazing, it's so bad my job blocks facebook. I don't even see the point of FB.
Jul 05 16:00:14 *	Kutagh agrees with beoran3 about FB
Jul 05 16:00:17 <AkumaStreak>	I have abandoned all social sites out of principle
Jul 05 16:00:32 <Kutagh>	tbh my reason for preferring handheld is because I already have a fine PC for gaming....
Jul 05 16:00:35 <AkumaStreak>	But whatevers. I am not good at determining what large audiences want
Jul 05 16:00:43 <Kutagh>	And disliking the gamepads for consoles
Jul 05 16:00:44 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 05 16:00:47 <AkumaStreak>	I usually think about what I want and small interest communities want
Jul 05 16:00:58 <AkumaStreak>	== commercial failures unless operation is kept very small
Jul 05 16:00:59 <AkumaStreak>	hehe
Jul 05 16:01:11 <beoran3>	beoran3: I was ok with /some/ dating sites, though, since it did helped me to meet some ladies. :)
Jul 05 16:01:18 <AkumaStreak>	How can one dislike the gamepad for a console
Jul 05 16:01:28 <AkumaStreak>	That's like liking cars without wheels
Jul 05 16:01:40 <AkumaStreak>	I miss tactile in iDevice space
Jul 05 16:01:43 <Kutagh>	AkumaStreak, I just don't like their layout and they're shit for my wrists too :p
Jul 05 16:01:59 <AkumaStreak>	Can't BELIEVE Apple hasn't released first party optional controller or sleeve with tactile controls yet
Jul 05 16:02:13 <AkumaStreak>	Ah, okies
Jul 05 16:02:20 <Kutagh>	especially the thumb sticks and the dpad/abxy buttons on the xbox 360 controller
Jul 05 16:02:37 <Kutagh>	its a pain to try to use both the thumb sticks and those buttons :X
Jul 05 16:02:39 <ps2chiper>	he needs to introduce another ipod sock
Jul 05 16:02:53 <AkumaStreak>	i like the 360 controller now. original design was absolutely horrid. dualshock design is still better really
Jul 05 16:03:09 <AkumaStreak>	as far as comfort to hold
Jul 05 16:03:33 <Kutagh>	Honestly I think if thumbsticks are important, you shouldn't place other buttons near them... :X
Jul 05 16:03:51 <Kutagh>	But rather place them at the other side :p
Jul 05 16:03:55 <AkumaStreak>	good point
Jul 05 16:03:58 <Kutagh>	the shoulder buttons are fine for me
Jul 05 16:04:12 <Kutagh>	way more natural to use
Jul 05 16:04:26 <AkumaStreak>	i think once they wanted to add the 2nd they had to choose something that worked ok vs not at all
Jul 05 16:04:32 <Kutagh>	thumbs for the thumb sticks, index and perhaps middle finger for shoulder buttons...
Jul 05 16:04:42 <Kutagh>	remainder for the buttons at the back side
Jul 05 16:04:43 <AkumaStreak>	but that's an interesting point as thumb can't do stick and buttons sim.
Jul 05 16:05:05 <Kutagh>	think about it, how you usually grip your controller
Jul 05 16:05:14 <AkumaStreak>	yeah it makes sense
Jul 05 16:05:17 <AkumaStreak>	fingers are already there
Jul 05 16:05:22 <Kutagh>	usually the ring and pinky are unused, wasted
Jul 05 16:05:28 <AkumaStreak>	very interesting idea would like to feel how prototype would feel
Jul 05 16:05:41 <Kutagh>	same :p
Jul 05 16:05:54 <Kutagh>	if those controllers are out there I might actually become interested into consoles
Jul 05 16:06:06 <Kutagh>	but for now... I'd rather save my wrists for other things
Jul 05 16:06:09 <AkumaStreak>	controllers are easy to make if someone in here wants to play with that idea of yours
Jul 05 16:06:11 <AkumaStreak>	or if you want to
Jul 05 16:06:48 <AkumaStreak>	you could take it to a 3rd party controller maker, they would rip you off, just sayin'
Jul 05 16:06:56 <Kutagh>	XD
Jul 05 16:07:20 <ps2chiper>	I been to one of those companies before
Jul 05 16:07:34 <ps2chiper>	all the controller brands just buy and dont invent

Jul 05 18:16:52 <RobinJ>	yeah... but thats always how it is on forums?
Jul 05 18:17:56 <Kutagh>	on shitty forums yeah :p
Jul 05 18:18:11 <Kutagh>	and honestly, I dont mind one or two bit useless posts
Jul 05 18:18:14 <RobinJ>	not everything has to contribute to the forums in general. compliments may contribute to the developer's dedication to the project. and questions may contribute to the informatrional part of a topic
Jul 05 18:19:27 <RobinJ>	thats my view on the matter anyway
Jul 05 18:19:46 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 05 18:20:00 <Kutagh>	meh whatever
Jul 05 18:20:10 <RobinJ>	and ehm.. shitty forums? as far as i know the only reason a forum keeps existing is because of the users. if admins ban users for posts not being a great contribution for everyone, then the forum'd die out in no time :p
Jul 05 18:20:47 <Kutagh>	fyi I was talking about bigger number of useless posts
Jul 05 18:20:59 <Kutagh>	as I said, I dont mind one or two useless posts
Jul 05 18:21:19 <Kutagh>	but if everyone does 10 useless posts and 1  useful post, I likely quit looking at that forum
Jul 05 18:21:34 <Kutagh>	cuz I cba to go through the useless shit to find the interesting posts
Jul 05 18:21:59 <RobinJ>	lol
Jul 05 18:22:04 <Kutagh>	and I think that people that mainly contribute too also would do that
Jul 05 18:22:25 <RobinJ>	not everything has to be blood serious :p
Jul 05 18:22:42 <Kutagh>	... as I said, I dont mind one or two useless posts.

Jul 05 18:28:28 <RobinJ>	some say 2012
Jul 05 18:28:35 <RobinJ>	maybe end of 2011 says on the website
Jul 05 18:28:51 <K3fka>	Well, that kind of sucks. I was hoping it'd be sooner.
Jul 05 18:31:44 <RobinJ>	rofl
Jul 05 18:31:52 <RobinJ>	take "bob time" into account
Jul 05 18:32:55 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:46:13 <RobinJ>	does anyone actually have any idea when the nD would be released?
Jul 05 18:32:55 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:46:38 <Triverske>	Robin, the nD will probably have a 2012 release date
Jul 05 18:32:55 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:47:07 <RobinJ>	i read on the forums that you have to take something called "bob time" into account? xD
Jul 05 18:32:55 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:47:44 <Triverske>	Yes, bob time is normal time times 7 divided by two times 1.03
Jul 05 18:32:56 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:48:13 <Triverske>	It also changes
Jul 05 18:32:59 <RobinJ>	jul 05 18:48:21 <Triverske>	depending on the day of the week

Jul 05 18:37:18 <Exophase>	Triverske; Speaking of #Triverske, I guess we should get a new IRC channel.
Jul 05 18:37:44 <Exophase>	I told some people at work what you're doing, didn't get around to asking if any EEs would be up for reviewing our drawings though..
Jul 05 18:38:58 <Exophase>	traeak; Even if PSV gets homebrew support a $200 homebrew console can manage at least GP2X/Wiz/Caanoo/Pandora/Dingoo sales
Jul 05 18:39:06 <Exophase>	Which is in the ballpark Triverske is interested in..
Jul 05 18:39:50 <RobinJ>	PSV?
Jul 05 18:39:52 <RobinJ>	PS Vita?
Jul 05 18:42:08 <Exophase>	Yes.
Jul 05 18:50:13 <traeak>	Exophase: seems to be enough of a market

Jul 05 18:50:48 <Exophase>	Yeah, he said he'd be happy with 20k. Bear in mind that the GP2X sold more than this despite being released after PSP was hacked, and with worse hardware all around.
Jul 05 18:51:00 <Exophase>	And no cheaper, afaik
Jul 05 18:51:10 <Exophase>	This handheld will at least be a little cheaper, and will have HDMI out
Jul 05 18:51:25 <traeak>	start with a sustainable market, then incrementally try to move up (if desired)
Jul 05 18:51:31 <Exophase>	And if it runs Android there's that much, even if PSV is hacked I doubt it'll get an Android port.
Jul 05 18:51:37 *	Exophase nods
Jul 05 18:52:20 <traeak>	what happened to that android wonderswan dealy ?
Jul 05 18:52:25 <Exophase>	But yeah, there's no way anyone small time could come anywhere close to PSV in terms of hardware. Hell, it'll be over a year before a fully competing third party SoC even exists..
Jul 05 18:52:30 <Exophase>	Odroid?
Jul 05 18:52:32 <traeak>	anyways, it was a piece
Jul 05 18:52:33 <Exophase>	It exists, it's low volume..
Jul 05 18:52:51 <Exophase>	They release new ones every time there's a new major Samsung SoC, they have some kind of arrangement with them, they're released like eval kits.
Jul 05 18:53:09 <traeak>	controls look bad
Jul 05 18:53:13 <Exophase>	So they're very cutting edge hardware-wise, you can buy an Exynos one today. But from what I understand the controls suck and they didn't change them since day one.
Jul 05 18:53:34 <Exophase>	I can't say for sure Triverske's will have great controls but at least there'll be a really sincere effort for there to be ;p
Jul 05 18:53:50 <Exophase>	By people who understand what good controls are..
Jul 05 18:53:57 <traeak>	yup
Jul 05 18:54:20 <traeak>	ds d-pad
Jul 05 18:54:27 <traeak>	decent buttons and i guess dual analog
Jul 05 18:54:37 <Exophase>	I'm a big proponent of real analog sticks, and I know PSV is doing that now too, but it'll still be good for a homebrew handheld to try it.
Jul 05 18:54:42 <Exophase>	I don't like nubs.
Jul 05 18:54:49 <traeak>	durability i wonder about
Jul 05 18:54:59 <traeak>	pockets and analog sticks probably dont' agree
Jul 05 18:55:09 <Exophase>	I think it's fine if they don't protrude much.
Jul 05 18:55:38 <traeak>	and you'd want an already existing analog stick of course
Jul 05 18:56:13 <traeak>	i always wonder about crackberry type optical nubs
Jul 05 18:57:11 <Exophase>	The part we're looking at is CTS 254
Jul 05 18:57:16 <Exophase>	Going to at least get some and try it.
Jul 05 18:58:20 <traeak>	so definitely you're going past vaporware
Jul 05 19:00:09 <traeak>	did you have any skin in the pandora exophase?
Jul 05 19:00:19 <Exophase>	Not really..
Jul 05 19:00:25 <Exophase>	I got a board but I didn't do anything with it.
Jul 05 19:03:11 <traeak>	be really nice to know what booboo is working on...IMHO nD is going nowhere....

Jul 05 22:37:36 <Syniphas>	:3
Jul 05 22:37:37 <Syniphas>	hi
Jul 05 22:38:07 <Triverske>	Well I talked to the rest of Triverske, they tend to approve of the idea
Jul 05 22:38:19 <Triverske>	not like they have a choice
Jul 05 22:38:41 <Syniphas>	ooh are you an entity like star trek's Q
Jul 05 22:39:31 <Triverske>	Like multiple personalities?
Jul 05 22:40:02 <Syniphas>	i dunno, you're the entity! you tell me
Jul 05 22:42:24 <Triverske>	Exophase, how much do you think a prototype would cost?
Jul 05 22:43:04 <Exophase>	I don't really know..
Jul 05 22:43:18 <Exophase>	It'd probably be somewhat driven by the rapid prototyping of the case.
Jul 05 22:43:21 <Triverske>	Ah
Jul 05 22:43:39 <Triverske>	Do you think it's a good idea to use the eval board as a dev device?
Jul 05 22:43:46 <Exophase>	You'd probably get a small run of PCBs, like a single panel or something, for several hundred.
Jul 05 22:43:58 <Exophase>	Yes, for a while at least.
Jul 05 22:44:15 <Exophase>	You can probably get samples of at least some of the components, for prototyping.
Jul 05 22:44:23 <Triverske>	Even with the eval board we have a lot more going for us than bob does
Jul 05 22:44:32 <Exophase>	The ones that are harder to get in very very low quantity.
Jul 05 22:44:45 <Exophase>	The ones that you can get in low quantity are cheap enough.
Jul 05 22:45:10 <Exophase>	Triverske; You think so? Bob certainly has an eval board of something, that's probably what his "prototype" is.
Jul 05 22:46:06 <Exophase>	I think you'd be very hard pressed to find any SoC on the market without an eval board, you can even commonly buy them for platforms you can't hope to buy in anything under hundreds of thousands of quantity.
Jul 05 22:46:21 <Exophase>	You can pretty easily get eval boards for Tegra 2, OMAP4, and Exynos for instance..
Jul 05 22:46:28 <Exophase>	The big three dual-core A9s out now.
Jul 05 22:46:59 <Exophase>	Used to be they'd cost several hundred or even thousand, but since Beagleboard more and more companies are selling these cheap.
Jul 05 22:47:24 <Exophase>	Now TI and Freescale do want to push these for low volume projects, so they come up with attractive solutions for hobbyists and not just companies.
Jul 05 22:48:03 <Exophase>	The Pandaboard is actually kind of an enigma to me, since TI hasn't announced any small scale variant of OMAP4 like there was with OMAP3..
Jul 05 22:48:14 <Exophase>	But I have a good feeling that will come out sooner or later.
Jul 05 22:49:06 <Triverske>	Well the thing is bob doesn't even show us his eval board, so something is up
Jul 05 22:50:31 <Exophase>	There's a good explanation for that, he said it himself.
Jul 05 22:50:40 <Exophase>	He trickles information out to generate hype.
Jul 05 22:50:48 <Exophase>	It's all a dumb attempt at marketting for him.
Jul 05 22:51:18 <Exophase>	But he also knows that showing the thing won't demonstrate anything useful.
Jul 05 22:51:24 <Exophase>	Said that himself too.
Jul 05 22:53:44 <Syniphas>	http://pastebin.com/SBXVnEmC
Jul 05 22:53:50 <Syniphas>	and they're still going
Jul 05 23:00:05 <Triverske>	Does the eval board have a touch screen?
Jul 05 23:02:14 <Exophase>	The QSB's? You can buy an add-on, it's $200
Jul 05 23:02:40 <Exophase>	I think a good early goal will be to buy a prospective LCD and make a cable for it, presuming it can match the QSB's setup w/o additional components.
Jul 05 23:02:58 <Exophase>	I THINK a normal one can, but no guarantees.
Jul 05 23:03:04 <Exophase>	You'll still need a cable made.
Jul 05 23:05:43 <Triverske>	mmmm
Jul 05 23:05:56 <Triverske>	I'm doing all of this so I can take OpenTTD with me
Jul 05 23:06:20 <Exophase>	I could ask zodttd to port it ;p
Jul 05 23:06:27 <Triverske>	I would love him
Jul 05 23:07:20 <Syniphas>	[00:07] <@Bloodsonic> all of these bugs will be fixed in 41 days, as notch is now on vacation
Jul 05 23:12:10 <Treeki>	zodttd porting it... would you have to pay for a pro version for the ability to save? :p

Jul 05 23:28:54 <Triverske>	Exophase, do you think now is the time for a handheld like this?
Jul 05 23:29:30 <Exophase>	As opposed to when?
Jul 05 23:29:34 <Exophase>	When other SoCs are available?
Jul 05 23:29:49 <Triverske>	Yes
Jul 05 23:30:07 <Exophase>	I think it's best to move forward with what you can but be as aggressive as possible with releasing newer ones later..
Jul 05 23:30:43 <Exophase>	This isn't like a Nintendo handheld, you don't have to stand by the same hardware for years.. it'll be a lot easier to provide basic compatibility, and if it's mainly going to be emulators anyway it won't be a big deal either way.
Jul 05 23:30:52 <Exophase>	You just don't want to end up too far behind.
Jul 05 23:31:02 <Exophase>	For all we know i.MX6 might offer a good migration path.
Jul 05 23:31:16 <Exophase>	I imagine you'll see that out in low quantity options next year
Jul 05 23:32:41 <Exophase>	That was announced some months ago.. i.MX51 really came out of nowhere in terms of availability, but it wasn't TOO long after OMAP3
Jul 05 23:35:13 <Exophase>	That'll actually have integrated HDMI
Jul 05 23:38:42 <Triverske>	Exophase, here's my plan, I accept preorders to a predetermined amount, and if the console ends up flopping I have the financial ability to bail myself out.
Jul 05 23:40:59 <Exophase>	I think it's low risk, if you can make the units and you don't underprice them you'll sell them.
Jul 05 23:41:09 <Exophase>	Enough to break even, I mean.
Jul 05 23:42:27 <Triverske>	So I'm pretty sure this device should be able to run most linux games
Jul 05 23:51:54 <Triverske>	Exophase, will games have to be ported or will normal linux games run fine?
Jul 05 23:54:42 <Exophase>	Normal Linux games won't work unless they're compiled for ARM..
Jul 05 23:54:47 <Exophase>	And even then it's not a sure thing..
Jul 05 23:54:53 <Triverske>	mmmm
Jul 05 23:55:13 <Triverske>	Is it a difficult process?
Jul 05 23:55:15 <Exophase>	There might be some in the repositories for their Ubuntu
Jul 05 23:55:22 <Triverske>	ah
Jul 05 23:55:22 <Exophase>	Not necessarily? Depends on the game.
Jul 05 23:55:26 <Triverske>	I see
Jul 05 23:56:20 <Triverske>	I'll just steal all of Pandora's games
Jul 05 23:56:31 <Exophase>	Yeah because it has oh so many ;p
Jul 05 23:56:37 <Triverske>	lol
Jul 05 23:56:43 <Exophase>	I could see if notaz can port Ginge to it...
Jul 05 23:57:26 <Triverske>	then it could run GP2X games and whatnot?
Jul 05 23:57:32 <Exophase>	Yes
Jul 05 23:59:20 <Triverske>	will you port gpSP: The Extremely Awesome Edition to this thing?
Jul 06 00:00:24 <Exophase>	I don't intend to, no :/ I'd rather do a new GBA emulator I guess. I could help others port it I suppose. It isn't hard.
Jul 06 00:00:31 <Exophase>	I just don't want to touch it myself.
Jul 06 00:00:48 <Triverske>	What would be the point of a new emulator when you already have a great one?
Jul 06 00:00:48 <Exophase>	http://www.linleygroup.com/newsletters/newsletter_detail.php?num=4691 < looks promising
Jul 06 00:01:06 <Exophase>	It's not like it's perfect, far from it.
Jul 06 00:01:20 <Exophase>	It's just not something I can work with. Like I said, it's easy enough for others to port, IMO
Jul 06 00:01:45 <Triverske>	It works with every commercial game I've ever tried
Jul 06 00:01:59 <Exophase>	Anyway, I don't think you should actually do an i.MX6 quad core in a future handheld.
Jul 06 00:02:03 <Exophase>	Just a dual..
Jul 06 00:03:22 <Triverske>	Should this thing have a successor, I will wait untill I can get better specs than anything on the market
Jul 06 00:04:20 <Exophase>	How would you?
Jul 06 00:04:40 <Exophase>	You can edge out cell phones perhaps, since you don't have to go through that kind of validation.
Jul 06 00:04:51 <Exophase>	But with the emerging tablet market..
Jul 06 00:05:02 <Triverske>	Handhelds only
Jul 06 00:05:10 <Exophase>	There are some chips you simply won't be able to get without orders in the hundreds of thousands or millions.
Jul 06 00:05:25 <Exophase>	And I flat out don't think you'll ever attract that kind of volume.
Jul 06 00:06:04 <Exophase>	A company might throw you a bone though, like TI was with Pandora, but it took so long to come out that it became moot.
Jul 06 00:06:12 <Exophase>	In 2008 OMAP3 would have been really cutting edge.
Jul 06 00:06:22 <Triverske>	Right.
Jul 06 00:06:40 <Exophase>	They'd do that entirely to promote the product.
Jul 06 00:07:46 <Exophase>	Anyway yeah, no point really thinking that much about long term roadmaps right now..
Jul 06 00:07:57 <Triverske>	I have roots with TI, but once again, there's no point in thinking that far ahead
Jul 06 00:08:03 <Exophase>	This will need to pass a few big milestones before it can even be considered beyond the brainstorming stage.
Jul 06 00:08:13 <Triverske>	indeed.
Jul 06 00:08:47 <Triverske>	and for the sake of myself, I'm changing the price to $199.99 in case of unforseen circumstances 
Jul 06 00:09:07 <Exophase>	On the surface it seems kind of lacking to have to use Cortex-A8 still, but actually I think 1.2GHz isn't too bad.
Jul 06 00:09:32 <Exophase>	It'll be maybe 20%ish behind 1.2GHz Cortex-A9s, and similar to 1GHz ones, on single-threaded..
Jul 06 00:09:41 <Exophase>	For emulators you won't find that much multi-threaded to begin with.
Jul 06 00:10:07 <Exophase>	And, you'd have a disadvantage with Tegra 2 which has no NEON. In fact, even Cortex-A9 with NEON has a bit of a disadvantage vs NEON on A8.
Jul 06 00:10:44 <Exophase>	In the usual software ecosystem this won't come up, but when emulators are center stage one heavily optimized one can make all the difference in the world.
Jul 06 00:11:36 <Exophase>	I thought about it more, and I see no problem with posting something discrete on gp32x to ask for EEs to give some oversight.
Jul 06 00:11:41 <Exophase>	If you would like me to.
Jul 06 00:12:01 <Exophase>	gp32x is a place for lots of homebrew handhelds and it should embrace this.
Jul 06 00:12:16 <Triverske>	I am okay with that, I would wait until I'm done with a final render though
Jul 06 00:12:27 <Triverske>	or at least a half decent one
Jul 06 00:12:27 <Exophase>	Also, would be good if we don't get the animosity of gp32spain like Pandora has
Jul 06 00:12:38 <Triverske>	how is that?
Jul 06 00:12:39 <Exophase>	Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying to promote or publicize this.
Jul 06 00:13:11 <Exophase>	Merely to say "we're working on a handheld and are looking for _____, please PM me if you're interested and I'll tell you more", I guess with a bit more description
Jul 06 00:13:14 <Exophase>	But I definitely don't like hype.
Jul 06 00:13:22 <Exophase>	It might be better for me to just PM some people directly, I don't know.
Jul 06 00:13:38 <Exophase>	I could even just say looking for EEs for a project and leave it at that :/
Jul 06 00:13:39 <Triverske>	People will listen to just about everything you say
Jul 06 00:13:45 <Exophase>	Normally that wouldn't work but I might get a few takers.
Jul 06 00:14:19 <Exophase>	I don't really know why gp32spain hates Pandora, but they do. They might hate anything non-GPH in the end.
Jul 06 00:14:31 <Exophase>	But if we could get them to pick us over Pandora it'd be to our advantage..
Jul 06 00:14:50 <Exophase>	Gonna go to sleep, seeya later
Jul 06 00:15:01 <Exophase>	If you see ps2chiper ask him which Micron component was 35rmb
Jul 06 00:15:11 <Triverske>	Okay
Jul 06 00:15:13 <Exophase>	If it's the 512MB LPDDR2 that'd be great.
Jul 06 00:17:24 <Triverske>	before you go, how possible is dreamcast emulation?

Jul 06 09:45:16 <--	Timic has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 06 09:45:44 <ps2chiper>	You got to micro manage everything, because all the parts come from different vendors. so the only way to keep it going is to stay on top of it. also it helps to keep cost down since they wont raise the price so high

Jul 06 09:47:41 <[]J>	heh
Jul 06 09:47:44 <ps2chiper>	Would you like an example?
Jul 06 09:47:49 <Triverske>	Yes
Jul 06 09:48:11 <ps2chiper>	My factory was building dvb-t tuners that were compatible with pal and secam
Jul 06 09:48:39 <ps2chiper>	the purchasing girl, switched vendors on the crystal and then it locked the tuner to pal only
Jul 06 09:48:45 <ps2chiper>	this was for a french customer
Jul 06 09:49:04 <ps2chiper>	they use secam in france, and the only dvb-t signal in china is pal
Jul 06 09:49:32 <ps2chiper>	so our factory had to take back 50k dvb-t tuners and change the crystals by hand
Jul 06 09:50:22 <ps2chiper>	that is real world experience you cant get from abroad
Jul 06 09:50:27 <Triverske>	that sounds painful enough
Jul 06 09:50:41 <ps2chiper>	its not like the way exophase makes it seem, where you write down all the parts and it works
Jul 06 09:51:08 <ps2chiper>	thats why I just stick to the schematics provided by the soc vendors and dont like to deviate from them
Jul 06 09:52:39 <Triverske>	Also, the Micron RAM, how much is it?
Jul 06 09:52:57 <ps2chiper>	the part number exophase provided is 33rmb per chip
Jul 06 09:53:38 <Triverske>	I wonder if it's possible to get 1GB of RAM
Jul 06 09:53:45 <Triverske>	that would be impressive
Jul 06 09:54:03 <ps2chiper>	512 on a handheld is too
Jul 06 09:54:52 <Triverske>	I agree
Jul 06 09:56:10 <ps2chiper>	Can someone write up a project detail for the eda and I will submit it to the geda mailing list.
Jul 06 09:57:12 <Triverske>	So that the PCB can be designed?
Jul 06 09:57:33 <ps2chiper>	pretty much, unless you want to make a dev board first like in a mini itx style
Jul 06 09:57:42 <ps2chiper>	then any chinese company can do that
Jul 06 09:57:59 <ps2chiper>	that cost 20k to 30k rmb
Jul 06 09:58:28 <ps2chiper>	a more sophisticated hand held design will require somebody with a excellent grasp of the english language
Jul 06 09:58:53 <Triverske>	It is a rather sophisticated design
Jul 06 09:59:21 <ps2chiper>	depends on how you want to stage it
Jul 06 09:59:35 <ps2chiper>	first dev board, or straight to hand held?
Jul 06 10:00:01 <Triverske>	I think we might get the eval board from Freescale
Jul 06 10:00:10 <Triverske>	then produce a working prototype
Jul 06 10:00:46 <ps2chiper>	Freescale has a list of approved hardware designers on their website

Jul 06 11:40:30 <traeak>	exactly
Jul 06 11:40:45 <traeak>	need to find the right price break for a new console
Jul 06 11:40:54 <traeak>	since soc's are advancing so fast
Jul 06 11:41:43 -->	emusan (Mibbit@synIRC-3BCFEBF3.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) has joined #nD
Jul 06 11:41:53 <emusan>	Hello Hello Hello
Jul 06 11:42:09 <traeak>	hmm
Jul 06 11:42:47 <traeak>	i've never played one of these types of games on a PC, only a console
Jul 06 11:43:44 <Triverske>	back
Jul 06 11:43:57 <emusan>	wot types of games?
Jul 06 11:44:00 <emusan>	Hi Triverske
Jul 06 11:44:11 <emusan>	anything new with the console?
Jul 06 11:44:12 <traeak>	garshasp or whatever its callled
Jul 06 11:44:15 <emusan>	I was gone most of yesterday...
Jul 06 11:44:16 <traeak>	god of war clone
Jul 06 11:44:19 <emusan>	ah
Jul 06 11:44:20 <traeak>	that whole family of games
Jul 06 11:44:27 <emusan>	I'm not a huge fan of them...
Jul 06 11:44:31 <emusan>	they're fun though I guess
Jul 06 11:44:39 <traeak>	they work well on consoles :-p
Jul 06 11:44:47 <emusan>	ja
Jul 06 11:44:52 <traeak>	but i don't see how they would be fun on a PC
Jul 06 11:45:00 <Triverske>	Waiting for OMAP 6
Jul 06 11:45:05 <Triverske>	:P
Jul 06 11:45:08 <traeak>	heh
Jul 06 11:45:17 <traeak>	all you really need is a single chip solution
Jul 06 11:45:19 <ps2chiper>	you mean omap5
Jul 06 11:45:32 <Triverske>	for the successor :P
Jul 06 11:46:00 <emusan>	wait so its not happenening?
Jul 06 11:46:00 <ps2chiper>	cortex a15 should outperform x86
Jul 06 11:46:14 <emusan>	I'm confus
Jul 06 11:46:16 <traeak>	at some level
Jul 06 11:46:21 <Triverske>	I'm saying the console after this one is going to use OMAP 6
Jul 06 11:46:23 <traeak>	x86 blows on performance per watt
Jul 06 11:46:27 <emusan>	ah
Jul 06 11:46:31 <Triverske>	but OMAP 6 doesn't exist
Jul 06 11:46:43 <emusan>	still going with the i.mx538?
Jul 06 11:46:45 <emusan>	for this one...
Jul 06 11:46:47 <Triverske>	yep
Jul 06 11:46:51 <Triverske>	Cheap and easy
Jul 06 11:46:56 <Triverske>	1Ghz
Jul 06 11:47:02 <Triverske>	not bad though
Jul 06 11:47:12 <traeak>	hopefully not a power hog
Jul 06 11:47:35 <ps2chiper>	i think i.mx535 is more realistic 
Jul 06 11:47:38 <emusan>	1GHz is more than enough...
Jul 06 11:48:08 <ps2chiper>	a friend said that the beagle boards production was not as easy as they made it out to be
Jul 06 11:48:17 <ps2chiper>	i got some docs to upload and share
Jul 06 11:48:46 <Triverske>	What kind of docs?
Jul 06 11:49:06 <traeak>	something not vapor is more than enough :-p
Jul 06 11:49:19 <traeak>	as far as i'm concerned you can kil the #nD channel and open a new one
Jul 06 11:49:34 <traeak>	pretty much have bob go blow :-p
Jul 06 11:49:39 <Triverske>	lol
Jul 06 11:49:54 <Triverske>	we have to answer all the newb questions though
Jul 06 11:50:00 <Triverske>	whenever they wander here
Jul 06 11:50:31 <emusan>	do they?
Jul 06 11:50:38 <emusan>	most newb's can't use irc...
Jul 06 11:50:46 <emusan>	or don't
Jul 06 11:50:54 <traeak>	i rarely use it
Jul 06 11:50:57 <emusan>	same
Jul 06 11:51:10 <emusan>	pretty much just nD and one other channel that is dead 90% of the time...
Jul 06 11:51:18 <ps2chiper>	i will upload to zshare
Jul 06 11:51:34 <Triverske>	IRC is 23 years old
Jul 06 11:52:44 <ps2chiper>	it was also used during the first gulf war
Jul 06 11:53:20 <Kutagh>	 yo emusan and Triverske :p

Jul 06 11:55:32 <Kutagh>	cuz they can
Jul 06 11:55:35 <emusan>	in the forums...
Jul 06 11:55:43 <Triverske>	Porting is the greatest idea, ever.
Jul 06 11:55:48 <ps2chiper>	http://www.zshare.net/download/92326811df17b6c3/
Jul 06 11:55:49 <emusan>	people are mad because dev's are porting other peoples works instead of making whole new games
Jul 06 11:55:53 <emusan>	I'm like lolwut
Jul 06 11:56:05 <traeak>	new content is hard
Jul 06 11:56:16 <ps2chiper>	well a good way to get someone to buy the handheld is to support all the classic games
Jul 06 11:57:01 <emusan>	I know...
Jul 06 11:57:31 <emusan>	I wanna port some stuff but I don't wanna pledge it in case I decide not to before the end lol
Jul 06 11:57:58 <emusan>	with college coming up and Triverske's console I dunno if nD will be as important in six months lol
Jul 06 11:58:58 <ps2chiper>	nothing is concrete
Jul 06 11:59:34 <emusan>	concrete is concrete...
Jul 06 11:59:44 <Triverske>	concrete is nothing

Jul 06 12:05:13 <emusan>	they don't need any
Jul 06 12:05:15 <emusan>	no crime
Jul 06 12:05:19 <emusan>	and they're smart
Jul 06 12:05:22 <emusan>	cause they're scientists
Jul 06 12:05:33 <emusan>	smart people don't commit crimes...
Jul 06 12:05:36 <traeak>	whatever, scientists are just people too
Jul 06 12:05:39 <ps2chiper>	im sure they worry about getting laid like the rest of us

Jul 06 12:05:53 <emusan>	artificial insemination
Jul 06 12:05:57 <traeak>	and scientists for some reason have an easier time rationalizing some brutal atrocities
Jul 06 12:05:59 <emusan>	cloning
Jul 06 12:06:00 <Triverske>	when I was 18 my friends were like "Hey Tri, let's go get a beer" and I'd be like "STFU I'm playing Halo"

Jul 06 12:08:56 <ps2chiper>	after looking at it, you need to find a pop memory supplier that has it in a 1gb or 512mb configuration
Jul 06 12:09:25 <Triverske>	what is the cost of 1GB of ram, 70rmb?

Jul 06 12:21:09 <emusan>	:(
Jul 06 12:21:10 <traeak>	you shouldn't be allowed to take a calculator into calculus
Jul 06 12:21:20 <emusan>	it's high school lol
Jul 06 12:21:32 <traeak>	even more reason
Jul 06 12:21:40 <emusan>	but yeah it does help too much in some cases
Jul 06 12:21:45 <ps2chiper>	TI Texas-India
Jul 06 12:21:50 <emusan>	there was a kid in there who could legally be considered a retard
Jul 06 12:22:13 <emusan>	but the AP exam does a decent job of rooting out the ones who know what they are doing..
Jul 06 12:22:27 <emusan>	only three kids got fives...
Jul 06 12:22:32 <ps2chiper>	what was the graduation rate of your year?
Jul 06 12:22:37 <emusan>	mine?
Jul 06 12:22:41 <ps2chiper>	yes
Jul 06 12:22:44 <emusan>	about 75% graduated lol
Jul 06 12:22:49 <emusan>	at least from my school
Jul 06 12:22:52 <ps2chiper>	better than california
Jul 06 12:22:54 <emusan>	the rest were probably drunk
Jul 06 12:23:10 <ps2chiper>	i think california has a 50% graduation rate
Jul 06 12:23:10 <emusan>	wait is that including drop outs?
Jul 06 12:23:20 <emusan>	that was 75% of those that stayed lol
Jul 06 12:23:22 <emusan>	for no reason
Jul 06 12:23:30 <emusan>	about 60% including drop outs....
Jul 06 12:23:38 <ps2chiper>	im talking about high school diplomas
Jul 06 12:23:45 <emusan>	but I don't really know how many dropped out...
Jul 06 12:24:19 <emusan>	well I'm saying of the people in my class freshmen year 60% actually got diplomas
Jul 06 12:24:26 <emusan>	the rest either failed hard or dropped out
Jul 06 12:24:27 <ps2chiper>	One thing I reflect back upon school, is how they only care about your feelings 
Jul 06 12:24:35 <ps2chiper>	they want everyone to have self esteem
Jul 06 12:24:40 <emusan>	lol ya
Jul 06 12:24:46 <emusan>	that and NO DRUGS!
Jul 06 12:24:57 <traeak>	something they started in the late 80s early 90s
Jul 06 12:25:01 <traeak>	bullshit
Jul 06 12:25:03 <emusan>	there were kids shooting up heroin in the middle school earlier this yer...

Jul 06 12:25:47 <emusan>	society is devlolving
Jul 06 12:25:52 <emusan>	only thing to do is watch a lot of porn
Jul 06 12:25:56 <traeak>	most folks in the newer generation are pretty damn selfish, can't take criticism and are unwilling to change (improve) themselves
Jul 06 12:26:16 <ps2chiper>	you know for the past 20k years children got beat

Jul 06 12:26:54 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 12:28:32 <ps2chiper>	I wish they would take all the kids from single mom crack heads and give them to gay couples
Jul 06 12:28:41 <emusan>	yes!
Jul 06 12:28:45 <emusan>	would be a great idea...
Jul 06 12:28:49 <emusan>	but americans are dumb...
Jul 06 12:29:09 <emusan>	think gay couples will make the kids gay
Jul 06 12:29:21 <emusan>	even though the majority of kids from gay couples turn out to be straight
Jul 06 12:29:22 <emusan>	and happy
Jul 06 12:29:38 <ps2chiper>	Most americans think of america as a christian country. but have no idea that jefferson was out back banging the bought help.
Jul 06 12:29:54 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 12:30:00 <emusan>	jefferson made his own version of the bible
Jul 06 12:30:04 <ps2chiper>	and probably none of the founding fathers were christians 
Jul 06 12:30:07 <emusan>	with no miracles and stuf...
Jul 06 12:30:20 <emusan>	have you seen religulous?
Jul 06 12:30:30 <ps2chiper>	really, do you got a link to that bible
Jul 06 12:30:37 <emusan>	idk...

Jul 06 14:51:30 <Kutagh>	da skyyyyyyy
Jul 06 14:51:33 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 06 14:52:01 <Kutagh>	finished sorting the received magic the gathering cards (you don't realize how much 2k cards is until you actually receive it...)
Jul 06 14:52:14 <emusan>	nice
Jul 06 14:52:17 <Kutagh>	as well as filtering the carts that were included too often
Jul 06 14:52:23 <emusan>	anything good?
Jul 06 14:52:32 <Kutagh>	well, didnt have an extensive collection
Jul 06 14:52:38 <Kutagh>	and saw quite nice cards to use :)
Jul 06 14:52:59 <Kutagh>	and I finally got non-basic lands (dual lands for example) as well as multicolored cards
Jul 06 14:53:07 <Kutagh>	and nice artifact cards too
Jul 06 14:53:07 <emusan>	cool
Jul 06 14:53:12 <emusan>	any artifiact lands?
Jul 06 14:53:16 <ps2chiper>	That is a lot of cards
Jul 06 14:53:24 <emusan>	those can go for ~$5 here...
Jul 06 14:53:28 <Kutagh>	ps2chiper, yeah I know
Jul 06 14:53:34 <Kutagh>	emusan, nope
Jul 06 14:53:44 <Kutagh>	though I have artifact cards that can generate mana
Jul 06 14:53:55 <Kutagh>	for green I saw nice enchant land cards
Jul 06 14:54:02 <Kutagh>	that when the land is tapped it generates 2 forests
Jul 06 14:54:16 <Kutagh>	gotta investigate whether it is 2 forests total or two more forests
Jul 06 14:54:33 <emusan>	neat..
Jul 06 14:54:37 <Kutagh>	yeah
Jul 06 14:54:47 <emusan>	have you played the computer versions?
Jul 06 14:54:48 <Kutagh>	unfortunately not a full playset but at least 2 of them, maybe 3
Jul 06 14:54:50 <Kutagh>	yeah
Jul 06 14:54:57 <emusan>	I'm thinking of getting one soz I don't have to buy so many cards lol
Jul 06 14:55:04 <Kutagh>	DotP 1 and 2 both
Jul 06 14:55:07 <emusan>	they only cost as much as a booster...
Jul 06 14:55:10 <emusan>	which is better?
Jul 06 14:55:13 <Kutagh>	they're nice if you just want to play the game itself
Jul 06 14:55:16 <emusan>	and are they as good as playing normally..
Jul 06 14:55:21 <Kutagh>	but shit if you want to actually deckbuild
Jul 06 14:55:27 <emusan>	why?
Jul 06 14:55:34 <Kutagh>	You can only modify existing decks slightly
Jul 06 14:55:41 <emusan>	thats kinda dumb...
Jul 06 14:55:46 <Kutagh>	ikr
Jul 06 14:56:00 <emusan>	so you cant take a bunch of cards and make an epic deck?
Jul 06 14:56:01 <Kutagh>	but they have quite nice decks though
Jul 06 14:56:03 <Kutagh>	correct
Jul 06 14:56:06 <emusan>	have you played wagic?
Jul 06 14:56:18 <Kutagh>	rings a bell, certainly havent played it :P
Jul 06 14:56:24 <emusan>	its great...
Jul 06 14:56:38 <emusan>	http://wololo.net/wagic/
Jul 06 14:56:44 <emusan>	its basically computerized magic..
Jul 06 14:56:47 <emusan>	with deckbuilding
Jul 06 14:56:53 <emusan>	but no purdy pictures...
Jul 06 14:57:08 <emusan>	and it doesn't have that co-op thing that 2 has...
Jul 06 14:57:18 <emusan>	but its pretty good otherwise
Jul 06 14:57:45 <Kutagh>	both DotP's have two-headed giant modes
Jul 06 14:58:03 <Kutagh>	the second one has archenemy mode too
Jul 06 14:58:24 <emusan>	yeah, archenemy is what I was referring to...
Jul 06 14:58:28 <emusan>	it looked neat
Jul 06 14:58:32 <Kutagh>	unfortunately (and I don't get why) you can never play as the archenemy, you have to play in the 3-players side
Jul 06 14:58:34 <Kutagh>	=.=
Jul 06 14:58:37 <emusan>	but if I cant build a deck I don't really wanna buy it...
Jul 06 14:58:51 <emusan>	https://www.boldport.com/ <<--- this is neat
Jul 06 14:59:02 <emusan>	FPGA thing
Jul 06 14:59:06 <emusan>	lol not magic
Jul 06 14:59:28 <Kutagh>	xD
Jul 06 15:00:57 <Kutagh>	btw emusan 
Jul 06 15:01:06 <Kutagh>	you can get assorted lots of magic cards cheaply
Jul 06 15:01:10 <Kutagh>	that is what I did
Jul 06 15:01:15 <Kutagh>	those 2k cards? €24
Jul 06 15:01:17 <emusan>	I know...
Jul 06 15:01:24 <emusan>	I'll prolly do it some time...
Jul 06 15:01:26 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 06 15:01:33 <Kutagh>	took me several hours to shift through it :p
Jul 06 15:01:35 <emusan>	just don't have the money now...
Jul 06 15:01:39 <Kutagh>	xD
Jul 06 15:01:52 <emusan>	hence why I want a nice PC version with all the cards...
Jul 06 15:01:59 <emusan>	I'll just stick with Wagic..
Jul 06 15:02:29 <Kutagh>	tbh WotC missed a golden opportunity to get a rage in magic going
Jul 06 15:02:50 <Kutagh>	if they actually make a game that has the collectible aspect of it...
Jul 06 15:02:50 <emusan>	you mean with the games?
Jul 06 15:02:55 <emusan>	ja
Jul 06 15:03:00 <Kutagh>	where you gain cards by winning matches
Jul 06 15:03:04 <emusan>	they could also have sold a TON of DLC lol
Jul 06 15:03:14 <Kutagh>	commons and uncommons only in AI matches
Jul 06 15:03:14 <emusan>	sell boosters of random cards as DLC
Jul 06 15:03:33 <Kutagh>	and rares and better mixed in as well against other players
Jul 06 15:03:41 <emusan>	some people wouldn't like that... some people don't like to interact online...
Jul 06 15:03:43 <Kutagh>	as well as cards as ante
Jul 06 15:03:48 <emusan>	wagic has a decent system..
Jul 06 15:04:02 <emusan>	you get in game cash which you can spend on specific cards for more money or boosters
Jul 06 15:04:03 <emusan>	for les
Jul 06 15:04:06 <emusan>	s
Jul 06 15:04:15 <emusan>	or on pre-constructed decks for a lot
Jul 06 15:04:31 <Kutagh>	I was coming onto that... >.>
Jul 06 15:04:50 <Kutagh>	anyway tbh AI fights are not great for having rares and such, since those fights can easily be abused
Jul 06 15:05:07 <emusan>	true....
Jul 06 15:05:12 <Kutagh>	while player versus player fights can't be mulligan-mulligan-restart-mulligan etc till a good starting hand is received
Jul 06 15:05:23 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 15:05:28 <Kutagh>	(that is actually what I did in some fights in DotP)
Jul 06 15:05:36 <emusan>	you shouldn't actually mulligan
Jul 06 15:05:38 <emusan>	that much
Jul 06 15:05:47 <Kutagh>	mulligan twice at most
Jul 06 15:05:54 <Kutagh>	if the first two hands are that shit
Jul 06 15:05:56 <emusan>	I almost never do...
Jul 06 15:06:00 <Kutagh>	such as 6 lands
Jul 06 15:06:06 <Kutagh>	or only 1 land and expensive cards
Jul 06 15:06:15 <emusan>	I'd play the 6 lands..
Jul 06 15:06:16 <Kutagh>	or no lands at all
Jul 06 15:06:24 <emusan>	I play if I have 2 or more...
Jul 06 15:06:39 <emusan>	I usually have a good mix of cheap cards in though..
Jul 06 15:06:52 <Kutagh>	depending on the remaining cards I might grab the 2 or 5 lands version
Jul 06 15:06:53 <emusan>	I've got a blue deck and a Myr deck...
Jul 06 15:06:56 <Kutagh>	but would prefer 3/4 lands
Jul 06 15:06:59 <Kutagh>	heh nice
Jul 06 15:07:04 *	Kutagh got some myr cards
Jul 06 15:07:09 <emusan>	Myr are epic...
Jul 06 15:07:17 <emusan>	so many infinite combo's lol
Jul 06 15:07:48 <emusan>	I can do infinite damage to another player and gain an inf/inf creature with trample with only 5 cards...
Jul 06 15:07:51 <emusan>	not including lands...
Jul 06 15:08:17 <emusan>	its so cheap but so much fun lol
Jul 06 15:08:20 <Kutagh>	I got a spare terramorphic expanse playset xD
Jul 06 15:08:26 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 15:08:28 <emusan>	sounds like fun
Jul 06 15:08:52 <Kutagh>	Razor Golem and Oxidda Golem are nice
Jul 06 15:09:02 <emusan>	ya...
Jul 06 15:09:06 <Kutagh>	razor has affinity for plains and oxxida for mountains
Jul 06 15:09:07 <emusan>	I gotta get a golems heart...
Jul 06 15:09:22 <Kutagh>	get 6 lands, draw a playset of that golem...
Jul 06 15:09:25 <Kutagh>	play it for free :D
Jul 06 15:09:37 <emusan>	I've got a lot of stuff with affinity for artifacts
Jul 06 15:09:49 <Kutagh>	sounds like you've traded well
Jul 06 15:09:49 <emusan>	by midgame I pretty much just put down whatever I draw lol
Jul 06 15:10:08 <emusan>	not really... I just bought a lot of myrodin last time
Jul 06 15:10:13 <Kutagh>	ah
Jul 06 15:10:15 <emusan>	well when it first came around...
Jul 06 15:10:19 <emusan>	not the recent ones...
Jul 06 15:10:25 <emusan>	and I got lucky
Jul 06 15:10:41 <emusan>	then I bought 3-4 more cards for it for ~$20
Jul 06 15:10:45 <emusan>	so worth it
Jul 06 15:10:47 <Kutagh>	IIRC the only pack we bought here was the 7th edition :p
Jul 06 15:10:56 <emusan>	its only a 45 card deck...
Jul 06 15:11:09 <emusan>	so not technically legal in some things
Jul 06 15:11:14 <Kutagh>	but with a booster pack afaik
Jul 06 15:11:19 <Kutagh>	which bumped it up to 60
Jul 06 15:11:25 <Kutagh>	or maybe even two
Jul 06 15:11:26 <Kutagh>	not sure
Jul 06 15:11:29 <emusan>	and its got a few cards that aren't legal in pretty much any artifact competition...
Jul 06 15:11:46 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 06 15:12:49 <Kutagh>	hmmm should try to get a free magic deck by registering on a site
Jul 06 15:13:19 <emusan>	lol sounds like a scam...
Jul 06 15:13:39 <Kutagh>	afaik it is a promotional stunt from WotC itself
Jul 06 15:13:47 <Kutagh>	its a deck of 30 cards only so.. :p
Jul 06 15:14:01 <emusan>	oh yeah... my dad got one of those...
Jul 06 15:14:25 <emusan>	they all say promo where the edition is too...
Jul 06 15:14:31 <emusan>	so not really worth cash...
Jul 06 15:14:45 <Kutagh>	so what?
Jul 06 15:14:52 <Kutagh>	I don't get them for the cash
Jul 06 15:14:54 <Kutagh>	but for the cards ;)
Jul 06 15:15:04 <emusan>	ya
Jul 06 15:15:06 <Kutagh>	btw a nice card for a Myr deck: Myr servitor :p
Jul 06 15:15:15 <emusan>	yeah, I've got 3-4 in there
Jul 06 15:15:18 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 06 15:15:24 <emusan>	and 4 retrievers
Jul 06 15:15:25 *	Kutagh got a spare Myr Servitor left...
Jul 06 15:15:43 <emusan>	lol I cant buy it if thats what you mean...
Jul 06 15:15:47 <emusan>	shipping would be insane
Jul 06 15:16:12 <emusan>	There's a pre-release tourney this saturday for the 2012 coreset...
Jul 06 15:16:13 <emusan>	I'm goin...
Jul 06 15:18:33 <Kutagh>	I wasnt talking about selling it to u :p
Jul 06 15:18:43 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 06 15:18:45 <Kutagh>	and nice, hf :p
Jul 06 15:18:49 <emusan>	just checkin...
Jul 06 15:19:21 -->	Triverske (Mibbit@synIRC-7EE9AD9D.lightspeed.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #nD
Jul 06 15:19:35 <Triverske>	Had to go buy a server
Jul 06 15:19:53 <emusan>	wewt
Jul 06 15:20:03 <beoran3>	I have (his idea for a "creatable card game". I n stead o collecting cards you can create them yorself as long as you follow certain rules. Every beneficial quality of the card increases t's cost, etc.
Jul 06 15:20:03 <emusan>	is it nice?
Jul 06 15:20:24 <Triverske>	Yeah, it's not a big one or anything
Jul 06 15:20:33 <emusan>	set up?
Jul 06 15:20:38 <Kutagh>	wb Triverske :p
Jul 06 15:20:39 <beoran3>	Does the server run linux, or freebsd openbsd netbsd? 
Jul 06 15:20:44 <emusan>	beoran3 I used to do stuff like that with my friends...
Jul 06 15:21:10 <emusan>	beoran3 One of us would usually just make up stupid rules though and then it became less fun...
Jul 06 15:21:20 <Kutagh>	beoran3, not a shitty idea... But part of what makes new cards great is breaking the rules :p
Jul 06 15:21:23 <Triverske>	I'm not sure what I'm going to install on it
Jul 06 15:21:29 <Triverske>	it didn't come with an OS
Jul 06 15:21:43 <emusan>	fancy
Jul 06 15:21:55 <emusan>	does it glow in the dark?
Jul 06 15:22:01 <Kutagh>	lol
Jul 06 15:22:04 <Triverske>	It does actually
Jul 06 15:22:08 <emusan>	wewt
Jul 06 15:22:11 <Kutagh>	does it touch itself during the night?
Jul 06 15:22:12 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 06 15:22:12 <emusan>	I love blinkinlights
Jul 06 15:22:16 <emusan>	I do!
Jul 06 15:22:20 <Triverske>	I'll take pics later at night
Jul 06 15:22:34 <emusan>	kewl
Jul 06 15:22:41 <beoran3>	emusan: the rules would be limited to a predefined ruleset. But it would allow infinite combinations. Just that your hyperpowered card will has a casting cost of 7956
Jul 06 15:22:53 <emusan>	ah
Jul 06 15:23:16 <emusan>	its still hard to balance something like that though...
Jul 06 15:23:23 <Kutagh>	yeah
Jul 06 15:23:27 <emusan>	even magic gets unbalanced at times...
Jul 06 15:23:35 <Kutagh>	what stops me from just getting a bunch of deathtouch creatures?
Jul 06 15:23:37 <beoran3>	Triverske: since you're in the USA (I presume) you might want to go for red hat or centos
Jul 06 15:23:50 <Kutagh>	mixed with indestructible creatures..
Jul 06 15:23:50 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 06 15:23:55 <Triverske>	Why not Ubuntu beoran?
Jul 06 15:23:57 <emusan>	I <3 CentOS
Jul 06 15:24:06 <beoran3>	Ubuntu is great for desktop
Jul 06 15:24:10 <Kutagh>	tbh Ubuntu aint exactly known as a server OS
Jul 06 15:24:11 <emusan>	Ubuntu < CentOS for servers
Jul 06 15:24:19 <Kutagh>	I know they got a server version of Ubuntu
Jul 06 15:24:19 <beoran3>	I'd not put it n a server though
Jul 06 15:24:35 <Kutagh>	but that's probably more suited to hobbyists
Jul 06 15:24:46 <beoran3>	sure and they have a desktop version of redhat/(fedora) as well, but....
Jul 06 15:24:47 <emusan>	you mean CentOS?
Jul 06 15:24:56 <beoran3>	no I mean ubuntu
Jul 06 15:24:59 <Kutagh>	emusan, I was talking about Ubuntu lol
Jul 06 15:25:03 <Triverske>	I totally forgot about fedora
Jul 06 15:25:04 <emusan>	oh lol
Jul 06 15:25:07 <Triverske>	I love fedora
Jul 06 15:25:08 <ps2chiper>	well at least with ubuntu you have a decent package management system
Jul 06 15:25:16 <Kutagh>	true that ps2chiper 
Jul 06 15:25:19 <emusan>	only problem with CentOS imho is yum...
Jul 06 15:25:21 <ps2chiper>	yum = throw up
Jul 06 15:25:24 <beoran3>	well if you love fedora, centeoss/redhat will be familiar
Jul 06 15:25:25 <emusan>	yar
Jul 06 15:25:38 <emusan>	you can install aptly on CentOS though
Jul 06 15:25:55 <ps2chiper>	did you buy a server just for fun?
Jul 06 15:26:10 <Triverske>	Gotta run two websites
Jul 06 15:26:10 <emusan>	lol no his hosting sucked
Jul 06 15:26:16 <Triverske>	other than that just for fun
Jul 06 15:26:23 <emusan>	I have a VPS...
Jul 06 15:26:25 <ps2chiper>	what kind of connection do you have?
Jul 06 15:26:26 <emusan>	just for fun
Jul 06 15:26:28 <emusan>	and for my site...
Jul 06 15:27:34 <ps2chiper>	fios or something?
Jul 06 15:27:40 <Triverske>	I'm running a 12mbps right now
Jul 06 15:27:52 <ps2chiper>	is your port 80 open?
Jul 06 15:28:10 <Triverske>	probably not
Jul 06 15:28:14 <ps2chiper>	is it a symmetric service
Jul 06 15:28:18 <Triverske>	let me config real quick
Jul 06 15:28:58 <ps2chiper>	probably charter? I think most isp's except for fios block port 80
Jul 06 15:29:03 <beoran3>	I'm also a webd eveloer with  lot of PHP/Ruby experiencee, of eel free to ask :)
Jul 06 15:29:25 <Triverske>	go look at RPGcreators.net and tell me what I'm doing wrong
Jul 06 15:29:34 <ps2chiper>	Help Triverske set up a consumer electronics brand

Jul 06 21:31:11 <Exophase>	Hi.
Jul 06 21:32:15 <emusan>	hey, haven't seen you in awhile...
Jul 06 21:32:26 <emusan>	I haven't been on at night much...
Jul 06 21:32:29 <emusan>	wots up?
Jul 06 21:33:48 <Exophase>	Nothing really, haven't seen anyone here yet today
Jul 06 21:34:05 <emusan>	we had some on earlier...
Jul 06 21:34:11 <emusan>	talked about magic cards
Jul 06 21:34:11 <Exophase>	I was looking at wifi stuff, the thing there is that I think it's essential that the exact module can be prototyped fully before choosing anything.
Jul 06 21:34:15 <emusan>	and some other stuff...
Jul 06 21:34:16 <Exophase>	Magic cards?
Jul 06 21:34:22 <emusan>	magic the gatherign?
Jul 06 21:34:24 <emusan>	ing*
Jul 06 21:34:30 <Exophase>	Okay.
Jul 06 21:34:31 <emusan>	its a card game thing
Jul 06 21:34:37 <emusan>	nerdy
Jul 06 21:34:48 <Exophase>	Yeah I know what it is. 
Jul 06 21:34:58 <emusan>	you mean the wifi module can be prototyped?
Jul 06 21:34:59 <Exophase>	ps2chiper was saying earlier not to use USB for wifi/BT, he insisted on SDIO
Jul 06 21:35:08 <Exophase>	You can get a few things in a discrete SDIO card.
Jul 06 21:35:16 <emusan>	probably better with SDIO...
Jul 06 21:35:19 <Exophase>	For prototyping, so long as the platform brings out SDIO to a card of course (the i.MX53 board does)
Jul 06 21:36:03 <Exophase>	He suggested 88W8686, but that isn't a wifi module, it's just the digital control. You need the radio still, and EEPROM, oscillator, some other stuff. Ideally you want a module.
Jul 06 21:36:26 <Exophase>	Marvell themselves did put out an SDIO card with a module with 8686, but it was a few years ago and you can't find it available anywhere. At all.
Jul 06 21:36:39 <emusan>	:(
Jul 06 21:36:42 <emusan>	thats unfortunate
Jul 06 21:36:56 <Exophase>	But since it's kinda old anyway it might not be an ideal choice to begin with.
Jul 06 21:37:11 <Exophase>	You can get SDIO cards with Qualcomm Atheros on it.. like 6002 and such.
Jul 06 21:37:19 <Exophase>	I didn't get any Chinese prices on that but it's on ic37 at least.
Jul 06 21:37:27 <Exophase>	Thing is, I haven't found anything on an SDIO card that is wifi + BT
Jul 06 21:37:45 <Exophase>	You can get that on USB though. The wifi + BT ones probably bring BT off to UART and not SDIO
Jul 06 21:38:44 <Exophase>	I just don't want to end up like Pandora did here.
Jul 06 21:38:53 <Exophase>	With a wifi that barely worked close to shipping..
Jul 06 21:38:58 <Exophase>	And today is still a little dodgy.
Jul 06 21:39:00 <emusan>	bluetooth isn't really /necessary/
Jul 06 21:39:10 <emusan>	yeah pandora fucked up with their wifi choices
Jul 06 21:39:28 <Exophase>	Using a separate BT chip wouldn't be the end of the world but it should definitely be avoided if possible..
Jul 06 21:39:56 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 06 21:39:57 <Exophase>	There are some eval boards for modules that connect to SDIO off the side, and have antennas and serial ports for UART I guess
Jul 06 21:40:03 <Exophase>	The thing is, I doubt those modules are cheap enough.
Jul 06 21:40:10 <emusan>	I heard some stuff about 1gig of ram... is that more likely now?
Jul 06 21:40:39 <Exophase>	I don't really think so, 512MB seems like a better target to me.
Jul 06 21:40:49 <Exophase>	Plus you want to give at least some room to move up for the next generation.
Jul 06 21:40:51 <emusan>	thats okay..
Jul 06 21:40:58 <Exophase>	Better to go to 1GB there than be forced into 2GB
Jul 06 21:41:11 <Exophase>	Just my opinion of course, Triverske ain't here
Jul 06 21:41:19 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 06 21:41:34 <Exophase>	Anyway, ps2chiper gave a price on a Micron part but he didn't say which -_-
Jul 06 21:43:11 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 21:43:22 <emusan>	all of them of course
Jul 06 21:43:51 <emusan>	did pandora use SDIO or something else?
Jul 06 21:44:53 <Exophase>	Yeah it's SDIO..
Jul 06 21:45:09 <--	Syniphas has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 06 21:45:35 <emusan>	lol any chance we could run into the same problems?
Jul 06 21:46:49 <Exophase>	That's why it should be prototyped.
Jul 06 21:47:18 <Exophase>	Atheros AR6102 is WiFi + BT, I think.
Jul 06 21:47:30 <Exophase>	Prototyping AR6002 then using that is probably a safeish bet.

Jul 06 21:56:14 <[]J>	yes
Jul 06 21:56:30 <emusan>	I think ps2chiper said you could help
Jul 06 21:56:35 <Exophase>	It seems like the project would desperately need someone local to help with correspondence.
Jul 06 21:56:35 <emusan>	cause you speak chinese...
Jul 06 21:56:41 <emusan>	that to
Jul 06 21:56:45 <emusan>	o
Jul 06 21:56:58 <Exophase>	Are you in Shenzhen?
Jul 06 21:57:11 <emusan>	I think ps2chiper said he was south...
Jul 06 21:57:14 <emusan>	may be wrong though...
Jul 06 21:57:29 <emusan>	south-er*
Jul 06 21:57:39 <Exophase>	Triverske did say he had an employee who spoke Chinese and went there a lot, so I dunno
Jul 06 21:57:56 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 06 21:59:07 <Exophase>	So I guess an early goal here is to get an i.MX53 QSB, a small Cortex-M3 board, those pots, an SDIO wifi card, and that 5" LCD, wire up the first three over UART and ADC inputs, and get a cable made for the LCD.
Jul 06 21:59:16 <Exophase>	Make the analog sticks show up as part of a Linux joystick driver or something.
Jul 06 21:59:34 <Exophase>	BTW I found a Cortex-M3 that's only 65 cents, even in low volume, from Arrow at that
Jul 06 21:59:47 <emusan>	which?
Jul 06 21:59:49 <Exophase>	You can probably get it from less elsewhere but I figure that's low cost enough.
Jul 06 22:00:05 <emusan>	I ordered those sticks...
Jul 06 22:00:08 <emusan>	to test the breakout...
Jul 06 22:00:14 <emusan>	should come this week...
Jul 06 22:00:17 <Exophase>	http://components.arrow.com/part/link/na/en/STM32F101T6U6A/STMicroelectronics?WT.mc_id=FindChips

Jul 06 22:01:06 <emusan>	stm32f103
Jul 06 22:01:07 <Exophase>	Just wire up the first UART to the QSB, or in this case do it over RS232 on both ends
Jul 06 22:01:13 <emusan>	I've got a little dev board for it...
Jul 06 22:01:21 <Exophase>	That'll be enough to slave the i.MX53 to program it.
Jul 06 22:01:27 <Exophase>	Then communicate back the stick values.
Jul 06 22:01:37 <emusan>	how many adc lines does that m3 have?
Jul 06 22:01:40 <Exophase>	Also hook up boot parameters and the reset line as GPIOs
Jul 06 22:01:43 <Exophase>	This one has 16 I think.
Jul 06 22:01:46 <emusan>	mine only has two I think :(
Jul 06 22:01:47 <emusan>	wow
Jul 06 22:02:00 <Exophase>	16 channels, obviously they're muxed on one or two real ADcs
Jul 06 22:02:01 <Exophase>	.. ADCs
Jul 06 22:02:15 <Exophase>	But it goes up to 1MHz sampling so it's all fine..
Jul 06 22:02:19 <emusan>	yeah, I think mine only has 2 channels thoug has well...
Jul 06 22:02:26 <emusan>	maybe not...
Jul 06 22:02:34 <emusan>	haven't really spent much time pouring over the datasheet yet lol
Jul 06 22:02:38 <Exophase>	I'm sure you'll never get all the channels unless you use no peripherals/GPIOs at all.
Jul 06 22:02:48 <Exophase>	Not on this chip which only has 26 I/Os
Jul 06 22:02:56 <Exophase>	And 36 pins
Jul 06 22:02:59 <emusan>	we wouldn't really be using that many pins anyway though..
Jul 06 22:03:03 <emusan>	mine is 72 I think..
Jul 06 22:03:13 <emusan>	with a few that are just empty though
Jul 06 22:03:24 <Exophase>	Anyway you only need 2 for the pots, or 4 if it's differential.
Jul 06 22:03:35 <Exophase>	And this uses an internal oscillator, clocks up to 36MHz
Jul 06 22:03:38 <Exophase>	Not a bad deal for 61 cents IMO
Jul 06 22:03:43 <emusan>	differential?
Jul 06 22:03:52 <emusan>	yeah thats pretty decent lol
Jul 06 22:03:53 <Exophase>	Yes, where you measure output and return.
Jul 06 22:04:02 <Exophase>	So cancel common mode noise.
Jul 06 22:04:06 <emusan>	ah
Jul 06 22:04:21 <emusan>	you would need 2 for each joystick though..
Jul 06 22:04:23 <Exophase>	Also want to be sure to power the pots and the ADC reference from the same source.
Jul 06 22:04:28 <emusan>	why not just do both joysticks on one chip?
Jul 06 22:04:40 <Exophase>	Well, not the pots themselves per se, rather the voltage divider circuit they're used in.
Jul 06 22:04:40 <emusan>	yar...
Jul 06 22:04:49 <emusan>	thats standard I believe...
Jul 06 22:04:51 <Exophase>	Yes, both joysticks on one chip is the plan, definitely.
Jul 06 22:05:05 <emusan>	pots are a voltage divider?
Jul 06 22:05:07 <emusan>	I think...
Jul 06 22:05:16 <emusan>	oh wait nevermind
Jul 06 22:05:17 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 22:05:17 <Exophase>	Pots will give variable resistance.
Jul 06 22:05:22 <emusan>	I just had a brainfart
Jul 06 22:05:47 <Exophase>	So the voltage will vary in a rational function.. for that reason you want to have much higher precision than the number of points you want to capture linearly.
Jul 06 22:05:49 <emusan>	lol I'm listening to an MIT lecture in another tab...
Jul 06 22:05:54 <emusan>	super multitasking ftw
Jul 06 22:05:56 <emusan>	but fail
Jul 06 22:06:11 <Exophase>	I guess I should buy a multimeter..
Jul 06 22:06:17 <emusan>	ya
Jul 06 22:06:19 <emusan>	for sure
Jul 06 22:06:27 <emusan>	you will die breadboarding without one
Jul 06 22:06:43 <emusan>	if nothing else than for connection testing
Jul 06 22:06:48 <emusan>	do you have a breadboard?
Jul 06 22:07:41 <Exophase>	Nope.
Jul 06 22:07:46 <Exophase>	I don't have anything.
Jul 06 22:07:56 <Exophase>	I'll need some help even with the pot circuit..
Jul 06 22:08:07 <Exophase>	You put a load resistor over pins 2 and 3 of the channel right?
Jul 06 22:08:17 <emusan>	uhh...
Jul 06 22:08:20 <emusan>	two and 3?
Jul 06 22:08:20 <Exophase>	Then measure between 1 and 3?
Jul 06 22:08:25 <emusan>	I've done one before...
Jul 06 22:08:31 <Exophase>	So 1 to ground and 3 to the ADC input?
Jul 06 22:08:45 <emusan>	pins on what?
Jul 06 22:08:49 <Exophase>	.. yeah that's not right >_>
Jul 06 22:08:50 <emusan>	lol I'm losted
Jul 06 22:08:54 <emusan>	not really
Jul 06 22:09:08 <Exophase>	Look at the datasheet for the potentiometer, the pins are 1 2 3 for one axis and 1' 2' 3' for the other, afaik
Jul 06 22:09:16 <emusan>	oh yeah...
Jul 06 22:09:19 <emusan>	I remember
Jul 06 22:09:23 <emusan>	1 to voltage
Jul 06 22:09:25 <emusan>	3 to ground
Jul 06 22:09:35 <emusan>	2 to another resistor to ground
Jul 06 22:09:41 <Exophase>	Alright.
Jul 06 22:09:43 <emusan>	then between 2 and the other resistor to adc input
Jul 06 22:09:58 <emusan>	depending on the other resistor you will get different ADC values
Jul 06 22:10:01 <emusan>	curves and such
Jul 06 22:10:03 <Exophase>	2 to ground over the load resistor?
Jul 06 22:10:10 <emusan>	thats all from memory lol
Jul 06 22:10:34 <emusan>	2 -> load resistor -> ground
Jul 06 22:10:47 <emusan>	2 -> pin -> loadresistor
Jul 06 22:10:51 <Exophase>	We need to pick a good load resistor value.
Jul 06 22:11:06 <emusan>	yeah, I've never done that though lol
Jul 06 22:11:07 <Exophase>	Then I need to know the transfer function.
Jul 06 22:11:16 <Exophase>	Well wikipedia at least has that equation >_>
Jul 06 22:11:17 <emusan>	the one I made I just used 10kOhm's
Jul 06 22:11:33 <Exophase>	It says the larger the load resistance, the less it contributes to the measurement.
Jul 06 22:11:57 <emusan>	yar
Jul 06 22:12:08 <emusan>	thats electricity physics...
Jul 06 22:12:43 <Exophase>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer < I take it for a 10k pot that means that R1 is 10k and R2 is 0 to 10k depending on the position?
Jul 06 22:13:55 <emusan>	uhh.. where is this?
Jul 06 22:14:01 <emusan>	nvm
Jul 06 22:14:03 <emusan>	middle page...
Jul 06 22:14:40 <emusan>	yeah, thats how the inside of a pot works...
Jul 06 22:15:13 <emusan>	actually I dunno
Jul 06 22:15:19 <emusan>	about what you said...
Jul 06 22:16:09 <[]J>	oh oops got distracted
Jul 06 22:16:14 <emusan>	lol
Jul 06 22:16:14 <[]J>	Exophase I'm in Luoyang ;1
Jul 06 22:16:18 <emusan>	blinking light?
Jul 06 22:16:34 <Exophase>	Okay, then if you made PCBs for this part why don't you solder some resistor to it, then tell me how to wire it to an ADC/supply voltage.
Jul 06 22:16:37 <[]J>	nah, girlfriend came in <#:)
Jul 06 22:16:49 <emusan>	okay, exophase, thats right actually
Jul 06 22:16:51 <Exophase>	And give me the transfer function.
Jul 06 22:17:04 <emusan>	okay
Jul 06 22:17:26 <emusan>	I'll just breadboard it though lol
Jul 06 22:17:29 <emusan>	no needs to solder
Jul 06 22:18:07 <Exophase>	I thought you said the pots wouldn't fit in breadboards?
Jul 06 22:18:19 <emusan>	dats why I make breakout
Jul 06 22:18:32 <emusan>	which PCB's you think I make?

Jul 06 22:31:20 <emusan>	that doesn't have the pot though
Jul 06 22:34:13 <Exophase>	Alright then.
Jul 06 22:36:53 <emusan>	lol we'll know if I'm right once they come...
Jul 06 22:37:32 <emusan>	what kind of work do you do with the microcontrollers?
Jul 06 22:38:06 <Syniphas>	Exophase: :O
Jul 06 22:38:16 <Syniphas>	did you ever host that bbs?
Jul 06 22:38:22 <Exophase>	BBS?
Jul 06 22:38:27 <Syniphas>	er
Jul 06 22:38:29 <Syniphas>	emusan
Jul 06 22:38:29 <Exophase>	emusan; You know, embedded stuff
Jul 06 22:38:35 <Exophase>	I'm in aerospace
Jul 06 22:38:35 <Syniphas>	wrong tab-complete sorry
Jul 06 22:39:16 <emusan>	syniphas not yet
Jul 06 22:39:23 <emusan>	getting to it lol
Jul 06 22:39:58 <emusan>	exophase, do you use some kind of bootloader? I'm thinking of using one soz I don't have to use JTAG all the time...
Jul 06 22:40:07 <emusan>	sorry if thats a well known thing lol
Jul 06 22:40:10 <emusan>	new to ARM
Jul 06 22:40:21 <Exophase>	For the STM32 for instance it has a bootloader on an embedded ROM
Jul 06 22:40:23 <Exophase>	No need for JTAG
Jul 06 22:40:41 <emusan>	ah
Jul 06 22:40:47 <emusan>	I thought I saw something about that
Jul 06 22:40:50 <Exophase>	I did a bootloader on PROM for a SPARC based CPU we're using in our current project..
Jul 06 22:40:52 <emusan>	but I didn't get specifics...
Jul 06 22:41:10 <Exophase>	Outside of that had to interact thruogh a debug port, but that was exposed via a UART so still didn't have to use JTAG.
Jul 06 22:41:30 <emusan>	mine is stm32...
Jul 06 22:41:37 <Exophase>	Yeah you said,
Jul 06 22:41:37 <--	Syniphas has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 06 22:41:41 <emusan>	what does the bootloader use?
Jul 06 22:41:44 <emusan>	lol I'm so newb...
Jul 06 22:41:51 <emusan>	would it work over USB?
Jul 06 22:41:57 <emusan>	mine supports it...
Jul 06 22:42:03 <Exophase>	On the newer ones yes, on the ones I've used it's UART
Jul 06 22:42:20 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 06 22:42:35 <emusan>	I'd prolly just use JTAG if it doesn't do usb...
Jul 06 22:42:37 <Exophase>	It's not worth bothering with using USB IMO, the nice thing about UART is it's very easy to write a custom interface for it.
Jul 06 22:42:51 <emusan>	yeah, but I gots no serial ports :(
Jul 06 22:42:53 <emusan>	laptop
Jul 06 22:43:01 <Exophase>	So get a USB to serial adapter, they're cheap..
Jul 06 22:43:10 <emusan>	yeah, I could...
Jul 06 22:43:18 <emusan>	but I have a nice little usb->JTAG...
Jul 06 22:43:37 <Exophase>	No guarantee your JTAG is supported though, much less the software you use..
Jul 06 22:43:49 <emusan>	it seemed pretty universal...
Jul 06 22:43:54 <emusan>	maybe...
Jul 06 22:43:56 <Exophase>	JTAG is anything but universal.
Jul 06 22:44:01 <emusan>	I'll see about a USB->serial...
Jul 06 22:44:03 <emusan>	oh wait..
Jul 06 22:44:10 <emusan>	I do haz USB-> serial lol
Jul 06 22:44:19 <emusan>	you ever heard of a bus pirate?
Jul 06 22:44:40 <Exophase>	No, is it a probe cable?
Jul 06 22:44:50 <emusan>	not really
Jul 06 22:44:58 <Exophase>	What is it?
Jul 06 22:45:03 <emusan>	http://dangerousprototypes.com/bus-pirate-manual/
Jul 06 22:45:23 <emusan>	its a tool for messing around with various busses
Jul 06 22:45:32 <Exophase>	Looks like a probe cable.
Jul 06 22:45:46 <emusan>	wot kind of probe?
Jul 06 22:45:59 <Exophase>	Logic analyzer or something
Jul 06 22:46:13 <emusan>	yeah, sorta
Jul 06 22:46:17 <Exophase>	Anyway, if we're going to hook up i.MX53 to STM32 I have to look at the I/O levels..
Jul 06 22:46:19 <emusan>	more like a bus analyzer though
Jul 06 22:46:24 <Exophase>	But it's probably 1.8V or something..
Jul 06 22:46:25 <emusan>	its too slow to do logic...
Jul 06 22:46:30 <Exophase>	So the UART will have to go through a level shifter..
Jul 06 22:46:41 <emusan>	thats no fun...
Jul 06 22:48:20 <Exophase>	Huh, it has "UHVIO" which can do 3.3V, no idea if UART goes through that..
Jul 06 22:48:44 <emusan>	is that ultra high voltag I/O?
Jul 06 22:48:50 <emusan>	I mean does it stand for that?
Jul 06 22:48:59 <emusan>	cause thats not really /ultra/ high voltage lol

Jul 06 23:03:42 <Syniphas>	it's just suffering a lack of activity right now
Jul 06 23:04:26 <Syniphas>	huh nice
Jul 06 23:04:35 <emusan>	kinda slow...
Jul 06 23:04:49 <Syniphas>	yes
Jul 06 23:04:58 <emusan>	lol your an hour ahead of me
Jul 06 23:05:05 <Exophase>	It says the pins which UART RX/TX default on are UHVIO
Jul 06 23:05:25 <emusan>	exophase thats good
Jul 06 23:05:39 <Exophase>	But I don't know if it can drive 3.3V levels
Jul 06 23:05:43 <Exophase>	Or if it's just 3.3V tolerant..
Jul 06 23:06:03 <emusan>	could the m3 understand lower than 3.3?
Jul 06 23:07:11 <Exophase>	There's a supply for it at 3.3V so it should work.. M3 can't do 1.8V
Jul 06 23:07:29 <Exophase>	Actually core here is 1.35V, I don't think there are 1.8V I/Os.
Jul 06 23:07:54 <--	Syniphas has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 06 23:08:26 <Exophase>	I take that back, there are three "UHVIO" supplies. One is 1.8V, one is 2.775V, and the other is 3.3V.

Jul 06 23:51:28 <Exophase>	Ideally we want a solution where the module or something close to it is available on a consumer SDIO card.

Jul 06 23:52:07 <Exophase>	Triverske; That one, 88W8868/8, is just part of a complete solution, it's just the digital part..
Jul 06 23:52:23 <Exophase>	You need other components to make it work. You can put these on a board yourself, but it's a lot easier to buy a module that contains all of it in a package.
Jul 06 23:52:39 <Exophase>	The thing is, modules based on that are old now, and it's hard to find an SDIO card with it.
Jul 06 23:52:53 <Triverske>	Emusan: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/51/photowzb.jpg/
Jul 06 23:53:04 <Triverske>	I see 
Jul 06 23:53:10 <Exophase>	AR6102 looks super cheap on alibaba
Jul 06 23:53:39 <emusan>	Triverske, its watching you
Jul 06 23:54:04 <Triverske>	It's actually facing towards my bed, I'm not sleeping anytime soon
Jul 06 23:54:36 <Exophase>	Anyway I suggest we make an early milestone an eval setup with i.MX53 QSB, an LCD (with custom cable), SDIO card with something close to what we want to use, Cortex-M3 over UART, potentiometers x2 connected to Cortex-M3, and I guess a battery.
Jul 06 23:54:47 <Exophase>	I don't recall if the i.MX53 board can connect straight to a battery or what.
Jul 06 23:55:05 <emusan>	i thought it said it had battery charging stuff...
Jul 06 23:55:08 <emusan>	maybe not...
Jul 06 23:55:16 <Exophase>	Chances are we wouldn't use the same PMIC, and maybe not the same RAM.. and some peripherals will be dropped.. but the closer we can get to a suitable hardware configuration the better.
Jul 06 23:55:38 <Triverske>	I agree
Jul 06 23:55:48 <emusan>	thirded
Jul 06 23:55:53 <Exophase>	I'm not sure yet if we'll need level shifters on the board to go from i.MX53 to Cortex-M3 over UART or not, for the eval boards it'll be moot because both will go through RS-232 transceivers..
Jul 06 23:56:11 <Exophase>	It actually looks like i.MX53 has 3.3V I/Os but I'm not sure how to get them to operate in that mode?
Jul 06 23:56:59 <Exophase>	Actually, let me look at the transceiver they use on the QSB, if it's a 3.3V to begin withone then that'll make things more straightforward..
Jul 06 23:57:03 <Exophase>	.. 3.3V one to begin with
Jul 06 23:57:13 <Exophase>	I need to start looking for real electrical people to help though.
Jul 06 23:57:31 <emusan>	yup
Jul 06 23:57:54 <emusan>	do you know anyone?
Jul 06 23:57:54 <Exophase>	We might still want to contract the layout work, that's less of an intimate thing.
Jul 06 23:58:04 <Exophase>	Maybe >_>
Jul 06 23:59:31 <emusan>	the qsb says it supports a Li-ION battery for "low power opperations"
Jul 06 23:59:58 <emusan>	oh and you have to solder the connector yourself...
Jul 07 00:00:07 <emusan>	you have a soldering iron exophase?
Jul 07 00:00:28 <Exophase>	No, I don't solder ;p
Jul 07 00:00:32 <Exophase>	But I'm sure I can learn eventually
Jul 07 00:00:46 <Exophase>	And people at work can help me..
Jul 07 00:01:12 <emusan>	soldering is easy compared to everything else here lol
Jul 07 00:01:21 <emusan>	if I can do it you can..
Jul 07 00:01:25 <Exophase>	Hardly an apples to apples comparison.
Jul 07 00:02:04 <emusan>	just if your going to do any make sure you get a decent soldering iron...
Jul 07 00:02:25 <emusan>	every time someone uses a cheap ass radioshack one a baby kangaroo dies
Jul 07 00:03:01 <Triverske>	I sincerely hope this project works out
Jul 07 00:03:08 <emusan>	same!
Jul 07 00:03:52 <Exophase>	Everything one step at a time.. just don't hype or get your hopes up too much.. but if you have money you can make things happen, I think.
Jul 07 00:05:07 <Triverske>	The biggest worry I have is something I won't be able to really control
Jul 07 00:05:19 <emusan>	wots dat?
Jul 07 00:05:23 <Triverske>	How are the parts going to get from wherever we order them to the factory
Jul 07 00:05:54 <emusan>	lol I think thats a question for ps2chiper
Jul 07 00:06:04 <emusan>	who should be here... its only 12pm there
Jul 07 00:06:12 <emusan>	or something like that
Jul 07 00:06:22 <Exophase>	He's probably working..
Jul 07 00:06:35 <emusan>	true
Jul 07 00:07:26 <Triverske>	That's my single biggest problem
Jul 07 00:07:32 <Triverske>	well not single
Jul 07 00:07:39 <Triverske>	but definitely the largest
Jul 07 00:07:46 <emusan>	I'm sure there are ways
Jul 07 00:07:55 <emusan>	people get stuff like this manufactured in china all the time...
Jul 07 00:08:01 <emusan>	even small groups
Jul 07 00:09:57 <Triverske>	Exophase, did Pandora have any problems with that?
Jul 07 00:15:20 <Exophase>	They had a lot of problems with the case being made.. but I would say they had plenty of problems with companies outside of China too
Jul 07 00:15:23 <emusan>	Triverske, what problems are you having with setting up the server?
Jul 07 00:15:38 <Exophase>	They personally think going Chinese isn't worth it now.
Jul 07 00:16:28 <Triverske>	So they have even bigger problems?
Jul 07 00:18:52 <Triverske>	Emusan, I'm just lazy :P
Jul 07 00:19:35 <emusan>	oh lol
Jul 07 00:20:05 <emusan>	I think the pandora guys had a lot of problems with getting the companies to do what they wanted and on time...
Jul 07 00:20:17 <emusan>	which is why ps2chiper recommends having a guy there
Jul 07 00:20:24 <emusan>	that speaks chinese and such
Jul 07 00:20:35 <Exophase>	But they're still having problems getting CircuitCo to do stuff and they're in Texas.
Jul 07 00:20:40 <emusan>	I know that the pandora guys had someone like that but I don't think he was there all the time...
Jul 07 00:20:41 <Exophase>	Then there was the nub company in Europe..
Jul 07 00:20:47 <emusan>	lol the nubs
Jul 07 00:22:41 <Triverske>	If I had an option, I'd probably want the work done @ ps2's factory
Jul 07 00:24:15 <Exophase>	I'm thinking you won't be able to have component assembly done in China to begin with.
Jul 07 00:24:25 <Exophase>	Meaning that you wouldn't have final assembly and shipment done in China either.
Jul 07 00:25:16 <Triverske>	meh
Jul 07 00:25:20 <Triverske>	Shipping costs money
Jul 07 00:25:24 <Triverske>	a LOT of money
Jul 07 00:25:33 <Triverske>	I have a feeling that will be a problem
Jul 07 00:26:01 <Exophase>	I'm sure it won't be that bad for large batches.
Jul 07 00:26:35 <Exophase>	And this way you can have inspection at a place you can more reasonably visit..
Jul 07 00:33:06 <Triverske>	mmm
Jul 07 00:33:29 <Triverske>	What's the next step?
Jul 07 00:34:03 <emusan>	prolly figure out the wifi thing...
Jul 07 00:34:51 <emusan>	then buy qsb and start prototyping... maybe... exophase?
Jul 07 00:35:37 <Exophase>	In the opposite order
Jul 07 00:35:45 <emusan>	oh
Jul 07 00:35:50 <emusan>	oh right
Jul 07 00:35:54 <emusan>	lol 12:30 here
Jul 07 00:36:06 <emusan>	watching monty python
Jul 07 00:36:09 <emusan>	its funny
Jul 07 00:41:48 <Triverske>	So I need the eval board?
Jul 07 00:46:30 <emusan>	I don't know if you exactly need one yet...
Jul 07 00:46:41 <emusan>	I think whoever is doing the software will need one...
Jul 07 00:46:51 <emusan>	I guess thats exophase now...
Jul 07 00:48:42 <Exophase>	Don't expect much if anything from me >_<
Jul 07 00:49:06 <emusan>	lol maybe someone else...
Jul 07 00:49:13 <Triverske>	He's Exophase, he can do what he wants
Jul 07 00:49:26 <Triverske>	How did you get your name Exophase?
Jul 07 00:49:27 <emusan>	I figured you've been doing so much so far lol
Jul 07 00:49:32 <Exophase>	Who knows :e
Jul 07 00:49:35 <Exophase>	Going to sleep now. G'night.
Jul 07 00:49:42 <Triverske>	noooooooooo
Jul 07 00:49:45 <Triverske>	How?
Jul 07 00:49:55 <emusan>	howd you get yours?
Jul 07 00:50:06 <Triverske>	:|
Jul 07 00:50:20 <emusan>	theres an answer
Jul 07 00:50:27 <Triverske>	Well
Jul 07 00:50:43 <Triverske>	Once upon a time there was a game called Pandemic 2
Jul 07 00:51:01 <Triverske>	It was a very difficult game, and millions failed at it
Jul 07 00:51:29 <Triverske>	(if you don't know, you create a virus and try to infect the world)
Jul 07 00:51:51 <Triverske>	I created the triverse virus, and somehow it became Triverske
Jul 07 00:51:56 <Triverske>	that is all
Jul 07 00:52:03 <emusan>	cooleo
Jul 07 00:54:43 <emusan>	I must be off to bed as well...
Jul 07 00:54:57 <Triverske>	I should be
Jul 07 00:55:01 <emusan>	cya

Jul 07 11:48:38 <ps2chiper>	just like their alcohol
Jul 07 11:48:46 <[]J>	pizza with corn and fish and fruits
Jul 07 11:48:51 *	[]J barf
Jul 07 11:48:51 <emusan>	ew
Jul 07 11:48:54 <emusan>	thats not pizza
Jul 07 11:48:55 <ps2chiper>	they will drink wine that taste like turpentine with anti freeze
Jul 07 11:48:55 <Triverske>	I think papa johns is the best fast pizza
Jul 07 11:48:59 <emusan>	thats an abomination
Jul 07 11:49:16 <emusan>	lol I have five local pizza places on one block
Jul 07 11:49:18 <traeak>	hehe
Jul 07 11:49:21 <emusan>	new england is the best
Jul 07 11:49:23 <ps2chiper>	also chinese people handle pizza like they are aliens
Jul 07 11:49:31 <traeak>	everything in china is fried to death in oil
Jul 07 11:49:36 <traeak>	gets old *really quick*
Jul 07 11:49:39 <emusan>	that I don't mind...
Jul 07 11:49:49 <emusan>	I'm a sucker for fried stuff lol
Jul 07 11:50:04 *	kutagh starts talking
Jul 07 11:50:04 <traeak>	not even deep fried, i mean vegetables, etc
Jul 07 11:50:08 <kutagh>	about pizza oven
Jul 07 11:50:08 <kutagh>	:p
Jul 07 11:50:11 <ps2chiper>	You must weigh a ton
Jul 07 11:50:12 <traeak>	but you can't eat fresh vegetables in china
Jul 07 11:50:16 <traeak>	you get poisoned
Jul 07 11:50:23 <ps2chiper>	thats not true
Jul 07 11:50:26 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 11:50:33 <emusan>	you can't eat in mexico
Jul 07 11:50:39 <emusan>	or you get the squirts
Jul 07 11:50:53 <ps2chiper>	you also get them in china
Jul 07 11:51:00 <traeak>	ps2chiper: i think you have to be acclimated to e coli infection to be able to eat fresh veggies in china
Jul 07 11:51:00 <Triverske>	You can't go to Mexico, you'll be shot
Jul 07 11:51:02 <emusan>	that sucsks
Jul 07 11:51:30 <ps2chiper>	did either jaded or triverske get diarrhea when you guys first came to china?
Jul 07 11:51:50 <Triverske>	I don't recall anything like that
Jul 07 11:51:56 <Triverske>	probably a good thing
Jul 07 11:51:57 <traeak>	every time i've been there i've had problems
Jul 07 11:52:08 <emusan>	your doing it wrong
Jul 07 11:52:31 <ps2chiper>	I did when i first came, its called travelers  diarrhea 
Jul 07 11:52:43 <emusan>	well... I was hungry
Jul 07 11:52:46 <traeak>	the US has uncommonly clean food and water
Jul 07 11:52:48 <emusan>	now not so much...
Jul 07 11:52:50 <traeak>	amazingly clean
Jul 07 11:53:13 <ps2chiper>	thats because all our food is hand picked by illegals
Jul 07 11:53:28 <emusan>	so is ours?
Jul 07 11:53:28 <ps2chiper>	and in china, their food is picked by locals
Jul 07 11:53:30 <traeak>	ps2chiper: what you get is consistent with ecoli infection...a few days of stuff with some blood in it...
Jul 07 11:53:40 <emusan>	oh...
Jul 07 11:53:42 <[]J>	picked by locals, and then placed on the floor
Jul 07 11:53:48 <traeak>	ps2chiper: and food handlers in china are horrible about keeping clean
Jul 07 11:53:56 <ps2chiper>	and pissed on by rats
Jul 07 11:54:02 <[]J>	you see dudes outside of "nice" restaurants cleanning and cutting shit outside on the ground :/
Jul 07 11:54:11 <ps2chiper>	yup
Jul 07 11:54:23 <ps2chiper>	also you can still buy a live chicken and choke it in china
Jul 07 11:54:27 <traeak>	and problems in restaurant where you have guys handing raw meat and then directly handling the food preparation without washing their hands, etc
Jul 07 11:54:31 <emusan>	that sounds like fun
Jul 07 11:54:46 <emusan>	have you done it ps2chiper?
Jul 07 11:54:47 <traeak>	yup, even in shanghai you find peddlers with live chickens
Jul 07 11:54:49 <ps2chiper>	Ill buy your own live chicken when you come and visit
Jul 07 11:55:04 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 11:55:07 <traeak>	frankly cleaning a chicken isn't worth the time and effort though
Jul 07 11:55:19 <ps2chiper>	they do it because of habbit
Jul 07 11:55:24 <traeak>	yeah
Jul 07 11:55:27 <ps2chiper>	its normally the old folks that buy them live
Jul 07 11:55:35 <traeak>	my wife was part of the new middle class, her mother lived with her
Jul 07 11:55:50 <ps2chiper>	where are you from traeak
Jul 07 11:55:54 <traeak>	and yeah, we still own that property and the 2 bedroom flat is worth more than my house now
Jul 07 11:56:11 <ps2chiper>	same issue in shenzhen
Jul 07 11:56:25 <traeak>	then again it's 2 blocks away from one of the largest malls in china...they were still working on the shops 2 years ago
Jul 07 11:56:27 <ps2chiper>	a house here cost more than one in america
Jul 07 11:56:48 <ps2chiper>	if you bought a house in 2008
Jul 07 11:56:50 <traeak>	population density....another blessing
Jul 07 11:56:53 <ps2chiper>	you would of doubled your money today
Jul 07 11:57:07 <traeak>	she bought her current flat in 2003 for 300k rmb i think
Jul 07 11:57:14 <traeak>	now its worth probably 2.4 million or something ?
Jul 07 11:57:18 <ps2chiper>	yup
Jul 07 11:57:22 <--	Triverske has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Jul 07 11:57:26 <emusan>	thats insane
Jul 07 11:57:29 <ps2chiper>	and in hong kong nobody can afford anything
Jul 07 11:57:32 <traeak>	bad part:  it's on the 6th floor, no elevator
Jul 07 11:57:40 <traeak>	but when she bought it there were fields surrounding the place
Jul 07 11:57:43 <ps2chiper>	hong kong has the worlds most expensive property 
Jul 07 11:57:59 <traeak>	the end of one of the subway lines is about 3 blocks from her place as well
Jul 07 11:58:14 <ps2chiper>	What did you do in shanghai
Jul 07 11:58:17 <traeak>	the subways are insanely packed
Jul 07 11:58:20 <traeak>	i don't live there now
Jul 07 11:58:25 <traeak>	i'm in the denver area -p
Jul 07 11:58:29 <ps2chiper>	did
Jul 07 11:58:32 <ps2chiper>	past tense
Jul 07 11:59:03 <traeak>	nah only visited some few times, not worked there
Jul 07 11:59:08 <ps2chiper>	I see
Jul 07 11:59:15 <traeak>	i'm sure i could get a killer job there if i wanted though :-p
Jul 07 11:59:23 <traeak>	i don't like big cities, never have
Jul 07 11:59:26 <emusan>	do you speak chinese?
Jul 07 11:59:35 <ps2chiper>	Today I told my wife, my ability to learn chinese is like her ability to learn electronics
Jul 07 11:59:40 <traeak>	no, only german and i would need to brush up
Jul 07 11:59:44 <kutagh>	heheh
Jul 07 11:59:57 <traeak>	at one point the germans thought i was a hollander..then i lost it all
Jul 07 12:00:22 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 12:00:25 <traeak>	so yeah, i could pick up chiinese if i  put any effort
Jul 07 12:00:39 <traeak>	my wife's english was too good frankly
Jul 07 12:00:53 <ps2chiper>	Some people are gifted with languages
Jul 07 12:01:01 <traeak>	she's not really
Jul 07 12:01:02 <ps2chiper>	i am not unfortunately 
Jul 07 12:01:09 <emusan>	I'm not...
Jul 07 12:01:14 <ps2chiper>	I mean you treak
Jul 07 12:01:14 <emusan>	I'm gonna go grab some lunch...
Jul 07 12:01:17 <traeak>	she just always had the best english in the places she worked
Jul 07 12:01:17 <emusan>	cya
Jul 07 12:01:20 <ps2chiper>	cheese it
Jul 07 12:01:30 <--	emusan has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Jul 07 12:01:39 <traeak>	and since they were always us, german, french, italian companies they all spoke english in the office
Jul 07 12:01:46 <traeak>	i mean with the "bosses"
Jul 07 12:02:15 <traeak>	i know a couple of girls from ukraine who are amazing with languages
Jul 07 12:02:48 <traeak>	they got visitation visas here and their english only had a very slight accent
Jul 07 12:02:55 <ps2chiper>	it helps when your bilingual at a young age
Jul 07 12:03:01 <traeak>	of course one girl knew about 7 languages and was fluent in them all
Jul 07 12:03:24 <traeak>	i would have been but my older sister had to go to speech therapy because of that
Jul 07 12:03:29 <traeak>	so mom stopped
Jul 07 12:03:54 <traeak>	it's not an uncommon problem with trying the bilingual thing
Jul 07 12:04:05 <ps2chiper>	my parents where too fucked up to raise me right
Jul 07 12:04:36 <traeak>	my younger daughter could pull it off, but she only understands chinese, she doesn't speak it
Jul 07 12:04:52 <ps2chiper>	so did you marry that chinese girl
Jul 07 12:04:59 <traeak>	heh
Jul 07 12:05:16 <ps2chiper>	?
Jul 07 12:05:19 <traeak>	me?  yes i'm married
Jul 07 12:05:25 <ps2chiper>	my wife wants a visa to america
Jul 07 12:05:34 <ps2chiper>	can you help me out figure all the bs
Jul 07 12:05:38 <traeak>	hehe
Jul 07 12:06:05 <traeak>	http://candleforlove.com/
Jul 07 12:06:06 <ps2chiper>	i just want to get a tourist visa for her, but over the internet they make it seem like its impossible to get a tourist visa after you are married
Jul 07 12:06:12 <traeak>	there's everything you might ever want to know
Jul 07 12:06:35 <traeak>	you're very fortunate
Jul 07 12:06:41 <ps2chiper>	why is that?
Jul 07 12:06:46 <traeak>	the embassy to do the interviews is in guangzhou
Jul 07 12:07:01 <traeak>	how long does it take you to get there?
Jul 07 12:07:10 <ps2chiper>	i think about all day
Jul 07 12:07:17 <ps2chiper>	i seen the line one time
Jul 07 12:07:48 <traeak>	so its far enough away to suck
Jul 07 12:07:53 <traeak>	btw the medical system in china scares me
Jul 07 12:08:46 <ps2chiper>	ok, but has your wife applied for a visitor visa to america before?
Jul 07 12:08:51 <traeak>	no
Jul 07 12:09:09 <traeak>	we went the k1 route
Jul 07 12:09:24 <ps2chiper>	well with that, they dont expect the person to go back to china to work
Jul 07 12:09:24 <traeak>	and my wife was dumb and let her chinese passport expire
Jul 07 12:09:28 <traeak>	that's our immediate headache
Jul 07 12:09:45 <traeak>	i understand
Jul 07 12:09:59 <[]J>	o deer
Jul 07 12:10:00 <traeak>	you can ask about the tourist visa on the site i posted
Jul 07 12:10:01 <traeak>	or search for it
Jul 07 12:10:04 <traeak>	i'm sure the question has come up
Jul 07 12:11:13 <traeak>	we had some wierd stuff with her visa...her birth certificate has the wrong date and people who aren't her parents on it
Jul 07 12:11:28 <traeak>	that's all from western china
Jul 07 12:11:42 <traeak>	so her mother isn't on her birth certificat (hehe)
Jul 07 12:11:56 <traeak>	so getting her a visitor visa is a problem
Jul 07 12:12:24 <traeak>	anyways
Jul 07 12:15:07 <--	ps2chiper has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 07 12:15:16 -->	ps2chiper (~jason@9634DFDD.E83BF076.6F75D2BF.IP) has joined #nD
Jul 07 12:23:59 <ps2chiper>	You know what really pisses me off, is they let 10's of millions of mexicans walk over the boarder, but they are so afraid of people from other countries, that they have bullshit policies to see who qualifies for a visa to america
Jul 07 12:26:37 <traeak>	yup
Jul 07 12:26:49 <traeak>	if you want to come illegally they wave you over
Jul 07 12:27:01 <ps2chiper>	its utter non sense
Jul 07 12:27:06 <traeak>	want to come legally?  go fsck yourself, wait about 12-18 months
Jul 07 12:27:56 <ps2chiper>	another thing I hate about those illegal mexican groups is how they only want to protect mexicans
Jul 07 12:28:26 <ps2chiper>	how about those starving africans and burma refugees, and all the other people suffering around the world
Jul 07 12:28:36 <ps2chiper>	nope fuck them, they dont speak spanish
Jul 07 12:31:14 <traeak>	ps2chiper: btw, business related question.  there are apparently 18+ MiDAS aerial sensors in china.  The chinese mapping companies are interested in our precision capability for processing these, the problem of course is support from our side (we're pretty small).
Jul 07 12:31:46 <traeak>	ps2chiper: the deal here is if we can demo our capability that can allow them to use these sensors for engineering grade work, we can probably make sales
Jul 07 12:32:05 <ps2chiper>	Well only to the point where they steal your technology
Jul 07 12:32:14 <ps2chiper>	what do you have in place to protect your ip 
Jul 07 12:32:17 <traeak>	no, the groups we would work with
Jul 07 12:32:28 <traeak>	are pretty big organizations, they would need the support, etc
Jul 07 12:32:35 <traeak>	so they themselves won't steal it
Jul 07 12:32:36 <traeak>	and frankly
Jul 07 12:32:51 <traeak>	working with some pretty advanced photogrammetry coimpanies
Jul 07 12:32:59 <ps2chiper>	all large chinese companies have connections to the pla
Jul 07 12:33:01 <traeak>	the europeans can't even figure out what we're doing, it scares them
Jul 07 12:33:06 <traeak>	even if we tell them
Jul 07 12:33:06 <ps2chiper>	their job is to steal the technology
Jul 07 12:33:12 <traeak>	i understand
Jul 07 12:33:31 <ps2chiper>	you got to take that into consideration when protecting your ip
Jul 07 12:33:37 <ps2chiper>	also chinese value secrets
Jul 07 12:33:37 <traeak>	we also uderstand for software a market is usually only good for 3-4 years
Jul 07 12:33:43 <traeak>	if you dont' continue to innovate the market window is gone
Jul 07 12:34:01 <ps2chiper>	You should read the on2 china story
Jul 07 12:34:39 <traeak>	to give you a rough idea, the guy i work with his software was used to inspect hail damage ont he space shuttle fuel tanks
Jul 07 12:34:56 <ps2chiper>	i see, that is some advance stuff
Jul 07 12:35:05 <traeak>	nah, our "successful" software is already cracked in china
Jul 07 12:35:16 <ps2chiper>	You know Im worrying about building consumer routers
Jul 07 12:35:16 <traeak>	it's a testament to its success...
Jul 07 12:35:47 <traeak>	orthovista ... pretty much 90+ of the imagery on google maps/bing maps is touched by that software
Jul 07 12:35:55 <ps2chiper>	so its already cracked in china, that should tell you something about what i just said about protecting your ip
Jul 07 12:36:19 <traeak>	we sold the rights to OV to inpho in germany
Jul 07 12:36:34 <ps2chiper>	I think a good way to approach it is what you would charge for a company to buy the ip 
Jul 07 12:36:35 <traeak>	and those folks who *want* support pay for the maintenance
Jul 07 12:36:49 <traeak>	i'm sure they'd rather mine our IP
Jul 07 12:36:49 <ps2chiper>	and just charge the same amount to the licensor 
Jul 07 12:37:20 <traeak>	we're selling some stuff to trimble
Jul 07 12:37:24 <traeak>	strange story anyways
Jul 07 12:37:46 <traeak>	ie: should make a ton fo money off that i need to beat my partner senseless on some of that work
Jul 07 12:38:01 <ps2chiper>	also remember you are talking to a high school drop out, so I can only talk about the most basic principles of chinese business
Jul 07 12:38:07 <Syniphas>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9435923/music/kingbuzzo.xm here's something unfinished i've been working on
Jul 07 12:38:19 <traeak>	frankly we would sell to government sponsored companies in china
Jul 07 12:38:35 <traeak>	coal mining, guys working on building high speed rail
Jul 07 12:38:43 <ps2chiper>	thats the only way a company can get that large is with the government approval
Jul 07 12:38:49 <traeak>	those groups would be pure idiots to steal software to support those operations
Jul 07 12:39:08 <ps2chiper>	chinese dont think, they do
Jul 07 12:39:15 <traeak>	crash a buncho f high speed trains just because they stole some processing software?
Jul 07 12:39:54 <ps2chiper>	your mis interpreting it
Jul 07 12:40:01 <traeak>	btw, it seems the high speed trains in china will be degraded anyways
Jul 07 12:40:07 <traeak>	improper engineering
Jul 07 12:40:11 <traeak>	how is that?
Jul 07 12:40:12 <ps2chiper>	just because its a bad idea to steal, doesnt mean they wont try
Jul 07 12:40:42 <ps2chiper>	they have enough money to pay you for the software, but at the same time, they want to reverse engineer it all
Jul 07 12:41:04 <traeak>	well we dont' care if they reverse engineer it frankly
Jul 07 12:41:14 <traeak>	if they do more power to them
Jul 07 12:41:20 <traeak>	we'll go do somehing more interesting and *we area*
Jul 07 12:41:23 <traeak>	*we are*
Jul 07 12:41:30 <ps2chiper>	then just worry about making as much cash as possible
Jul 07 12:41:38 <ps2chiper>	dont look to it as a long term investment
Jul 07 12:41:47 <ps2chiper>	get the chunk upfront
Jul 07 12:41:51 <traeak>	as mentioned we're working with supposedly high powered groups across the world and they don't understand what we're doing
Jul 07 12:41:56 <ps2chiper>	then if things go sour, you dont need to worry
Jul 07 12:42:08 <traeak>	ps2chiper: exactly what we're looking at
Jul 07 12:42:19 <ps2chiper>	what?
Jul 07 12:42:31 <traeak>	ps2chiper: and our company last year grossed less than 1 million last year
Jul 07 12:42:39 <kutagh>	ps2chiper, getting all the dough asap :p
Jul 07 12:42:45 <traeak>	and we don't go into dept
Jul 07 12:42:47 <kutagh>	that's what traeak was sayin
Jul 07 12:42:51 <ps2chiper>	Their is a video on youtube about chinese business negotiations 
Jul 07 12:43:06 <traeak>	i know, and my wife very well knows as well
Jul 07 12:43:21 <ps2chiper>	so you know their goal is to fuck you?
Jul 07 12:43:26 <traeak>	financial controller/auditor was what she did...and did that as a contractor for 3 years
Jul 07 12:44:00 <traeak>	well, there's no market in the US, no real market in europe.  Someone else has been working in the middle east (talk about corruption)
Jul 07 12:44:17 <ps2chiper>	oh yeah, middle east is more corrupt than china
Jul 07 12:44:19 <traeak>	the japanese are *very* tough customers
Jul 07 12:44:47 <traeak>	we've done some pilot projects in dubai/jedda but corruption as you mentioned
Jul 07 12:44:57 <ps2chiper>	so whats your salary, for that type of software?
Jul 07 12:45:31 <traeak>	a partner of ours may have won a contract to fly all of afghanistan but as you konw there's issues for deploying an aircraft with a million dollar payload in afghanistan
Jul 07 12:45:39 <traeak>	and issues of corruption, etc
Jul 07 12:46:33 <ps2chiper>	Do you have stock in your company?
Jul 07 12:47:31 <ps2chiper>	Hey, could do you use something similar to kinnect to do 3d modeling?
Jul 07 12:48:31 <traeak>	no it's not public
Jul 07 12:48:34 <traeak>	umm
Jul 07 12:48:52 <traeak>	we do some stuff with laser scanner + cameras
Jul 07 12:49:09 <traeak>	we've been avoiding the actual modelling itself
Jul 07 12:49:24 <traeak>	and working on feeding precision to the modelling software
Jul 07 12:49:39 <ps2chiper>	how much processing power do you need to do modeling on the fly
Jul 07 12:50:04 <traeak>	ie: calibrate payload to precision and adjusting all the data together, mostly automatic and very high throughput
Jul 07 12:50:14 <traeak>	point cloud stuff?
Jul 07 12:50:40 <traeak>	have a dual core i7 (original) one test we densified about a billion points in ~15 mins ?
Jul 07 12:51:05 <ps2chiper>	is that slow or fast?
Jul 07 12:51:21 <traeak>	it took about 1 hour to fly the mission with a helicopter
Jul 07 12:51:54 <traeak>	everyone obsesses over building models
Jul 07 12:52:18 <ps2chiper>	I mean if you are trying to build a 3d map of the topography, how long does that take?
Jul 07 12:52:54 <traeak>	the problem is we aren't currently extracting polygons, cylinders, etc (well, i'm sort of working on that now)
Jul 07 12:53:05 <traeak>	extracting from just the imagery i mean
Jul 07 12:53:32 <traeak>	something like EATE or NGATE typically takes about 5-10x longer than collection to do terrain extraction
Jul 07 12:53:44 <traeak>	we were told our current stuff is dramatically faster than those products but
Jul 07 12:53:50 <traeak>	we just have nominal algorithms inplace right now
Jul 07 12:53:56 <ps2chiper>	could that software be used for self driving cars?
Jul 07 12:54:46 <traeak>	we'd prefer using that software for road, bridge and rail construction
Jul 07 12:54:50 <traeak>	it's more profitable
Jul 07 12:55:30 <ps2chiper>	I understand, but if you start building robocop's. I will be your best customer!!!
Jul 07 12:55:38 <traeak>	it's called "as built" ... extracting blueprints from what's already there
Jul 07 12:56:27 <traeak>	my phone died...battery
Jul 07 12:56:44 <ps2chiper>	did you get my last message
Jul 07 12:56:49 <traeak>	(303) 493-1910
Jul 07 12:56:50 <traeak>	oops
Jul 07 12:57:22 <traeak>	yeah i did

Jul 07 12:58:11 <traeak>	someone told us this is currently the "gold standard" for 3d city modelling
Jul 07 12:58:21 <traeak>	i think its some silverlight BS, can't say for certain
Jul 07 12:58:29 <ps2chiper>	doesnt support linux
Jul 07 12:58:46 <traeak>	yeah, i can't view it
Jul 07 12:58:59 <ps2chiper>	chinese love windows xp
Jul 07 12:59:04 <traeak>	they love stealing it
Jul 07 12:59:08 <ps2chiper>	they will be using it for the next 10 years
Jul 07 12:59:29 <traeak>	pure trash
Jul 07 12:59:40 <ps2chiper>	what does your wife use?
Jul 07 12:59:49 <traeak>	i have her running xfce on arch :-p
Jul 07 13:00:08 <traeak>	she uses her tablet a lot as well
Jul 07 13:00:19 <ps2chiper>	im sure she hates it
Jul 07 13:00:40 <traeak>	sure she hates what?
Jul 07 13:00:48 <ps2chiper>	linux
Jul 07 13:00:50 <traeak>	she likes it a lot actually
Jul 07 13:01:12 <ps2chiper>	thats hard to believe, windows xp is in their blood
Jul 07 13:01:18 <traeak>	her computers were pathetic...underpowered, the kingsoft crap brings any machine to its knees
Jul 07 13:01:53 <ps2chiper>	but thats what they love

Jul 07 13:17:10 <traeak>	my wife isn't totally typical chinese either
Jul 07 13:17:46 <traeak>	funny enough her nephew is a natural genius at art...i've been wondering about trying to abuse him to do some game art...just have to have a game to do
Jul 07 13:18:09 <traeak>	ie: he doing realistic sketches at age 3 or so
Jul 07 13:18:22 <traeak>	and his idiot parents totally discouraged him from doing that stuff
Jul 07 13:18:25 <traeak>	another chinese-ism
Jul 07 13:18:26 <emusan>	still going on about china I see...
Jul 07 13:20:04 <kutagh>	yo emusan 
Jul 07 13:20:10 <emusan>	hi
Jul 07 13:21:17 <ps2chiper>	did you get your cheese
Jul 07 13:22:04 <emusan>	me?
Jul 07 13:22:11 <emusan>	I didn't have any cheese...
Jul 07 13:22:14 <emusan>	I had hot dogs
Jul 07 13:22:20 <emusan>	I'm having pizza for dinner though :P
Jul 07 13:22:36 <emusan>	are there hot dogs in china?

Jul 07 13:24:18 <emusan>	lol never you just talked...
Jul 07 13:24:20 <ps2chiper>	yeah
Jul 07 13:24:22 <emusan>	nevermind*
Jul 07 13:24:33 <emusan>	how much would 32MB of RAM cost?
Jul 07 13:24:53 <ps2chiper>	sdram, about 5-10 rmb
Jul 07 13:24:54 <emusan>	these people on the forums are pissing me off thinking that 64MB is going to cost dollars more than 32
Jul 07 13:25:37 <emusan>	thats less than $1.5 at most...
Jul 07 13:25:39 <ps2chiper>	maybe 1 dollar more
Jul 07 13:25:42 <emusan>	lol thanks...
Jul 07 13:26:13 <ps2chiper>	what happens is sdram actually uses twice as large as a footprint of ddr2
Jul 07 13:26:26 <ps2chiper>	its more costly in space
Jul 07 13:26:47 <emusan>	ah
Jul 07 13:27:01 <emusan>	I don't think there will be too much space problems with the nD though
Jul 07 13:27:04 <emusan>	its pretty empty
Jul 07 13:27:15 <emusan>	wifi, SoC, and RAM afaik
Jul 07 13:28:00 <ps2chiper>	thats not the soc, thats triverskie device
Jul 07 13:28:07 <ps2chiper>	i mean nD
Jul 07 13:28:16 <emusan>	I think nD is using an SoC as well...
Jul 07 13:28:21 <emusan>	not as fancy
Jul 07 13:28:45 <emusan>	oh and I just got the analog sticks today
Jul 07 13:28:48 <emusan>	they are TINY
Jul 07 13:29:16 <emusan>	and sexy
Jul 07 13:29:41 <ps2chiper>	good, figure out an analog to digital process so you can use them on your pc
Jul 07 13:30:01 <emusan>	lol I'll try...
Jul 07 13:35:43 <ps2chiper>	Also traeak should change his name to NEO
Jul 07 13:35:55 <emusan>	lol why?
Jul 07 13:36:03 <ps2chiper>	Since he works with software that meer mortals like us will never see
Jul 07 13:36:03 <emusan>	is he the chosen one?
Jul 07 13:36:09 <emusan>	oooh
Jul 07 13:36:10 <ps2chiper>	pretty much
Jul 07 13:36:10 <emusan>	like what?
Jul 07 13:36:25 <emusan>	traeak what software do you work with?
Jul 07 13:36:32 <ps2chiper>	he is basically building a our world into the matrix
Jul 07 13:36:45 <traeak>	emusan: engineering crap....sensor payloads, lidar, etc
Jul 07 13:36:47 <traeak>	what's funny is
Jul 07 13:37:06 <traeak>	our last product was for using handheld digital cameras for cutting countertops :-p
Jul 07 13:37:07 <Syniphas>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9435923/music/kingbuzzo.xm extended it a bit
Jul 07 13:37:10 <Syniphas>	still unfinished
Jul 07 13:37:28 <traeak>	sold that off to a countertop manufacturer....not a ton fo money in that either though
Jul 07 13:37:36 <emusan>	wewt more moosic's
Jul 07 13:38:35 <traeak>	all these new and cell phone cameras are shit...adding in auto focus and auto stabilization basically makes them worthless for measurement use
Jul 07 13:39:01 <ps2chiper>	hey, how much would you charge for working on xbmc
Jul 07 13:39:18 <ps2chiper>	I want to fuck boxee, plex and the rest of them over
Jul 07 13:39:29 <Treeki>	[19:00:25] <traeak> i have her running xfce on arch :-p
Jul 07 13:39:31 <Treeki>	good choice :p
Jul 07 13:40:00 <traeak>	right now we only have netbooks at home
Jul 07 13:40:15 <traeak>	i cleaned out all my computer crap last year
Jul 07 13:41:02 <ps2chiper>	right now all the soc's want to support android, so much amlogic released an android stb port
Jul 07 13:41:20 <ps2chiper>	its a piece of shit, and the only way to sell an stb these days would be to port xbmc 
Jul 07 13:41:20 <traeak>	that's a good thing about android
Jul 07 13:41:27 <traeak>	helps make the drivers easier hopefully
Jul 07 13:41:34 <ps2chiper>	nope
Jul 07 13:41:36 <traeak>	and if you aren't running java shit you'll get good performance
Jul 07 13:41:55 <ps2chiper>	android is shit for non phones
Jul 07 13:41:56 <emusan>	I don't like android...
Jul 07 13:42:06 <emusan>	yar, google dun goofed on that one
Jul 07 13:42:12 <traeak>	android is acceptable for what it does on a tablet IMHO
Jul 07 13:42:21 <emusan>	not on my tablet...
Jul 07 13:42:24 <traeak>	i prefer gingerbread now
Jul 07 13:42:32 <emusan>	just because its not official...
Jul 07 13:42:46 <emusan>	I don't have gingerbread though :(
Jul 07 13:42:49 <emusan>	just 2.2
Jul 07 13:43:46 <ps2chiper>	well, it sucks when you need to build something and every soc out their only supports android
Jul 07 13:43:56 <ps2chiper>	they act like linux doesnt exist now
Jul 07 13:44:15 <ps2chiper>	you can ask amlogic
Jul 07 13:44:32 <ps2chiper>	the boss doesnt even know what linux is and claims they only have android
Jul 07 13:44:44 <ps2chiper>	and these are the companies we depend on

Jul 07 13:46:02 <emusan>	its called the eDGe
Jul 07 13:46:08 <emusan>	from a company called entourage
Jul 07 13:46:14 <emusan>	it was on woot real cheap so I got one
Jul 07 13:46:17 <traeak>	ps2chiper: that's damn scary....sadly that's our experience with sensor guys
Jul 07 13:46:25 <emusan>	it has an LCD+eink screen
Jul 07 13:46:26 <traeak>	it's like there's guys who know how to do hardware
Jul 07 13:46:28 <emusan>	dual screen...
Jul 07 13:46:31 <traeak>	ugh
Jul 07 13:46:40 <traeak>	i mean companies eithe rdo hardward or they do software
Jul 07 13:46:42 <traeak>	but almost never both
Jul 07 13:46:44 <emusan>	but the company went down and never released an SDK :(
Jul 07 13:46:48 <ps2chiper>	right
Jul 07 13:46:59 <ps2chiper>	what soc do they use?
Jul 07 13:46:59 <traeak>	and each type of company thinks the other is "just magic" that automatically happens
Jul 07 13:47:07 <ps2chiper>	haha
Jul 07 13:47:12 <emusan>	ps2chiper I don't know
Jul 07 13:47:15 <ps2chiper>	you are dead on with that statemeant
Jul 07 13:47:17 <emusan>	some marvell 1.2 GHz thing I think
Jul 07 13:47:24 <ps2chiper>	well crack it open and find out
Jul 07 13:47:30 <emusan>	someone did...
Jul 07 13:47:33 <emusan>	just a sec
Jul 07 13:47:51 <emusan>	problem is no one knows how it talks to the e-ink
Jul 07 13:47:53 <traeak>	and its worse when a hardware company thinks it can just build software capability
Jul 07 13:48:04 <emusan>	so doing a port of 3.0 is out of the question until we figure that out...
Jul 07 13:48:13 <traeak>	the biggest problem really is that there's a lack of systems engineers out there
Jul 07 13:48:17 <ps2chiper>	whats even worse is when they build linux from windows
Jul 07 13:48:37 <traeak>	hehe
Jul 07 13:48:55 <traeak>	yeah...it's amazing how many of these hardware companies build their capture systems using windows
Jul 07 13:49:01 <ps2chiper>	thats a trait of chinese, you can see a chinese guy coding on xp, and he is modifying the linux kernel
Jul 07 13:49:03 <traeak>	and then they have problems with reliability, etc
Jul 07 13:49:04 <traeak>	duhhhh
Jul 07 13:49:21 <ps2chiper>	chinese really hate linux
Jul 07 13:49:39 <traeak>	why ?  no exposure to anything else?
Jul 07 13:49:44 <ps2chiper>	they refuse to immerse them selves into it
Jul 07 13:49:46 <traeak>	the chinese don't like to think out of the box ?
Jul 07 13:50:02 <ps2chiper>	nope, when you think outside of the box, you get revolutions 
Jul 07 13:50:07 <traeak>	i know
Jul 07 13:50:13 <ps2chiper>	they want robots
Jul 07 13:50:42 <traeak>	one guy we are working with...he was in beijing trying to train some guys how to use a static laser scanner for the imperial palace grounds
Jul 07 13:51:05 <traeak>	he said the guys there were so scared of touching anything they'd rather do nothing than do something and maybe make a mistake
Jul 07 13:51:05 <emusan>	static laser scanner sounds cool
Jul 07 13:52:40 <ps2chiper>	he was probably afraid of a static shock
Jul 07 13:52:57 <emusan>	ps2chiper my tablet has a 1.2 GHz Marvell ARMADA PXA168
Jul 07 13:53:10 <emusan>	I'd be afraid of lasers killing everyone

Jul 07 13:53:45 <emusan>	you have more?
Jul 07 13:54:02 <traeak>	that tablet is strange
Jul 07 13:54:22 <traeak>	i have a nook color and a gtablet (gtablet was sort of for work)
Jul 07 13:54:23 <ps2chiper>	armada is a strange chip
Jul 07 13:54:29 <ps2chiper>	they have a closed source sdk
Jul 07 13:54:40 <emusan>	lol that sucks
Jul 07 13:54:54 <emusan>	I don't really need much more out of it though
Jul 07 13:54:59 <emusan>	Amazon appstore is fine...

Jul 07 13:56:33 <emusan>	they didn't really advertise it...

Jul 07 13:58:25 <emusan>	thats a lot
Jul 07 13:58:30 <emusan>	why do you even need one?
Jul 07 13:58:33 <emusan>	and why not just buy one?
Jul 07 13:58:36 <emusan>	I mean make one
Jul 07 13:58:39 <ps2chiper>	to build routers
Jul 07 13:58:47 <emusan>	ah
Jul 07 13:58:53 <ps2chiper>	well im sure if i had th cash to make one, i wouldnt want to build routers
Jul 07 13:58:56 <emusan>	tell your company you need
Jul 07 13:58:57 <emusan>	it
Jul 07 13:59:01 <emusan>	as a company expense
Jul 07 13:59:16 <ps2chiper>	who wants to tell emusan how cheap chinese are?
Jul 07 13:59:32 <emusan>	I thought it was an american company
Jul 07 13:59:35 <emusan>	in china...
Jul 07 13:59:57 <ps2chiper>	no, im not that lucky, and for the last time i am a high school drop out
Jul 07 14:00:01 <ps2chiper>	nobody would hire me
Jul 07 14:00:05 <ps2chiper>	i got to make my own luck
Jul 07 14:00:15 <emusan>	whats the recepie for that?
Jul 07 14:00:27 <ps2chiper>	well, you got to build something that sells
Jul 07 14:00:43 <ps2chiper>	before I build a software to connect a router to a satellite receiver
Jul 07 14:00:51 <ps2chiper>	built*
Jul 07 14:00:55 <ps2chiper>	dam 2 am
Jul 07 14:00:55 <traeak>	emusan: not really any new apps, nokia abandoned it, etc...
Jul 07 14:01:07 <traeak>	emusan: mine seems to be picky about charging
Jul 07 14:01:18 <emusan>	traeak yeah, that does suck, but the community is pretty good...
Jul 07 14:01:21 <emusan>	how so?
Jul 07 14:02:17 <traeak>	emusan: i wonder if the stupid microusb port has a poor connection
Jul 07 14:02:34 <traeak>	btw, i'm *not* impressed with microusb...it's a shitty connector
Jul 07 14:02:49 <emusan>	yar..
Jul 07 14:02:55 <emusan>	mini ftw
Jul 07 14:03:09 <traeak>	why did the cell phone industry decide to standardize on micro ?
Jul 07 14:03:22 <emusan>	ps2chiper, what do you mean by building a software to connect a router...
Jul 07 14:04:19 <ps2chiper>	connect the serial port of a satellite receiver to a routers uart port to do card sharing
Jul 07 14:04:25 <ps2chiper>	so you can steal tv
Jul 07 14:05:00 <traeak>	that's what you want to do with your box ps2chiper?
Jul 07 14:05:29 <ps2chiper>	nope

Jul 07 19:37:53 <emusan>	hiii
Jul 07 19:37:55 <Exophase>	emusan; Yo
Jul 07 19:38:03 <emusan>	heyhey
Jul 07 19:38:07 <emusan>	got those sticks...
Jul 07 19:38:07 <Exophase>	It's like you said about the pot.. I talked to a coworker today and he told me not to put a big resistor on it ;p
Jul 07 19:38:13 <emusan>	they're tiny...
Jul 07 19:38:15 <Exophase>	Yeah I ordered a bunch of stuff today.
Jul 07 19:38:20 <emusan>	kewl
Jul 07 19:38:23 <emusan>	the qsb?
Jul 07 19:38:29 <emusan>	or just other stuff?
Jul 07 19:38:35 <Exophase>	The QSB, a Cortex-M3 board, a meter, some wire strippers, some socket to cable wires, and some of those pots.
Jul 07 19:38:45 <emusan>	cooleo...
Jul 07 19:39:00 <Exophase>	I might try taping wire to the pot :/
Jul 07 19:39:06 <Exophase>	Or just go to work and try to get someone to help me solder it.
Jul 07 19:39:07 <emusan>	I'll prolly make some breakouts tomorrow and friday...
Jul 07 19:39:30 <emusan>	did you get the switching ones?
Jul 07 19:39:32 <Exophase>	BTW, your Cortex-M3 board is probably mislabeled.
Jul 07 19:39:34 <Exophase>	Yes.
Jul 07 19:39:39 <emusan>	mislabeled?
Jul 07 19:39:47 <Exophase>	I mean, where it says 2 ADC.
Jul 07 19:39:50 <emusan>	the switch on them isn't really the best...
Jul 07 19:39:53 <Exophase>	Or I wouldn't say that exactly, but it's misleading.
Jul 07 19:40:04 <emusan>	oh yeah... I looked at it again, and it is 16 channels
Jul 07 19:40:05 <Exophase>	It's 2x8 channel like all the rest.
Jul 07 19:40:06 <emusan>	should have mentioned
Jul 07 19:40:10 <emusan>	ya
Jul 07 19:40:16 <Exophase>	What's wrong with the switch?
Jul 07 19:40:24 <Exophase>	I'm sure it's really hard to properly judge this w/o a cap.
Jul 07 19:40:35 <emusan>	I wouldn't say its wrong, its jut not very "clicky"
Jul 07 19:40:41 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 07 19:40:44 <Exophase>	But better than nothing?
Jul 07 19:40:48 <emusan>	but pushing down it doesn't make a click
Jul 07 19:40:49 <emusan>	oh yeah
Jul 07 19:40:50 <Exophase>	The thing with sticks..
Jul 07 19:40:56 <emusan>	its way better than psp...
Jul 07 19:40:59 <Exophase>	Look at Pandora, it's just a nub so no click of course.
Jul 07 19:41:07 <Exophase>	But it uses them for mouse control in xfce.
Jul 07 19:41:19 <Exophase>	So left nub moves the mouse, right nub "clicks"
Jul 07 19:41:25 <Exophase>	And using the right like that is pretty shitty.
Jul 07 19:41:33 <Exophase>	If you had a push click for mouse click that'd be 100x better.
Jul 07 19:41:41 <emusan>	yeah..
Jul 07 19:41:46 <emusan>	it takes some pressure to click it though
Jul 07 19:41:50 <Exophase>	Then make either stick move the mouse, left left click, right right click.
Jul 07 19:41:56 <Exophase>	That's good, you don't want to accidentally do it.
Jul 07 19:42:00 <emusan>	but mine are still in the styrofoam so its hard to tell...
Jul 07 19:42:21 <Exophase>	Have you played around with measuring the resistance on it?
Jul 07 19:42:29 <emusan>	not yet lol
Jul 07 19:42:38 <emusan>	I got 10k's though
Jul 07 19:42:44 <Exophase>	I'm hoping that I'll be able to do something to read the values into the QSB very soon after I get it.
Jul 07 19:42:44 <emusan>	but that shouldn't change too much
Jul 07 19:42:47 <emusan>	just sensitivity
Jul 07 19:42:48 <Exophase>	I got 100ks
Jul 07 19:42:59 <Exophase>	It doesn't change sensitivity..
Jul 07 19:43:11 <emusan>	no?
Jul 07 19:43:15 <emusan>	what would it change
Jul 07 19:43:19 <Exophase>	What my coworker told me is that lower is better for less input impedence if your ADC is limited. We looked at the datasheet and for our sample rates we're fine.
Jul 07 19:43:23 <Exophase>	Meanwhile, higher = less power consumption.
Jul 07 19:43:48 <Exophase>	I am actually a bit concerned that the LCD we're looking at will be too power heavy.
Jul 07 19:44:22 <Exophase>	Guess we'll find out on that one.
Jul 07 19:44:55 <Exophase>	One other thing, the interface cables for those, these 40 pin FCB cables.. the pinout is standard, or at least I found other LCDs that use it.
Jul 07 19:45:15 <emusan>	thats good
Jul 07 19:45:17 <Exophase>	So it's possible that the LCD board Freescale sales can have the LCD transplanted in.
Jul 07 19:45:23 <Exophase>	Otherwise, I'll need someone to make a PCB for me.
Jul 07 19:45:24 <emusan>	LCD's are always the power sucker though
Jul 07 19:45:41 <Exophase>	That has the connector on it, and plugs into the ext
Jul 07 19:45:43 <traeak>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_trackpad
Jul 07 19:45:48 <Exophase>	Yeah, but this one is 1.7W max :/
Jul 07 19:45:52 <traeak>	how are these for gaming ?
Jul 07 19:46:02 <Exophase>	That's 1W for the backlight, 0.7W for the LCD
Jul 07 19:46:04 <traeak>	and i wonder how much they cost
Jul 07 19:46:10 <Exophase>	I'm hoping that you can run the backlight at waaaay under full
Jul 07 19:46:18 <emusan>	traeak look at the playstation phone thing
Jul 07 19:46:35 <Exophase>	Haven't heard great things about the Xperia Play's track pads.
Jul 07 19:46:37 <emusan>	exophase, we can do what the psp did and only offer some levels when on battery
Jul 07 19:46:41 <emusan>	and some when plugged in
Jul 07 19:46:51 <traeak>	emusan: so it uses those, gotcha
Jul 07 19:46:57 <Exophase>	Oh, I don't mind if people blow their battery by running it too bright. That's their problem.
Jul 07 19:47:05 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 19:47:11 <Exophase>	I just want there to be a reasonable option here.
Jul 07 19:47:19 <Exophase>	And not battery going from awful to really awful :/
Jul 07 19:47:36 <emusan>	yeah
Jul 07 19:47:39 <Exophase>	Another thing, is that the brightness uniformity of this display might not be ideal..
Jul 07 19:47:48 <Exophase>	But the response time is just so much better than most of what you see in this form factor.
Jul 07 19:47:51 <emusan>	hmm...
Jul 07 19:47:59 <Exophase>	Really we've just gotta buy one and see.
Jul 07 19:48:04 <emusan>	true
Jul 07 19:48:11 <Exophase>	I did find this available on some daughter board for some other eval board..
Jul 07 19:48:18 <Exophase>	But it looks like this place's website is gone.
Jul 07 19:48:22 <traeak>	what's the cost on one of those optical trackpads?
Jul 07 19:48:25 <emusan>	lol thats not good
Jul 07 19:48:36 <Exophase>	Can't catch a break ;)
Jul 07 19:48:48 <traeak>	i could see using analog right side, trackpad left side
Jul 07 19:49:01 <emusan>	I think both analog is better
Jul 07 19:49:06 <emusan>	either both or neither...
Jul 07 19:49:16 <Exophase>	Yeah I agree..
Jul 07 19:49:18 <emusan>	are we doing a touchscreen?
Jul 07 19:49:26 <emusan>	android will kinda be sux without it....
Jul 07 19:49:27 <Exophase>	Yes.
Jul 07 19:49:30 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 07 19:49:45 <Exophase>	I think this LCD has it as an option, but I don't really know. The thing is, it's on the pinout. Although not well labeled.
Jul 07 19:49:47 <emusan>	has triverske been on at all today?
Jul 07 19:49:50 <Exophase>	So I THINK it's on the pinout.
Jul 07 19:49:57 <Exophase>	I don't know, I just got here an hour ago, I work during the day.
Jul 07 19:50:10 <traeak>	i've never liked aiming with an analog stick with FPS, i thought a trackpad would make it more "mouse like"
Jul 07 19:50:10 <emusan>	he wasn't on much earlier...
Jul 07 19:50:22 <emusan>	I do prefer M+K
Jul 07 19:50:42 <emusan>	but on something handheld I don't really want to be swiping my thumb around everywhere
Jul 07 19:50:46 <emusan>	at least not on the go
Jul 07 19:50:51 <Exophase>	I don't think this will be a huge FPS platform, it'll probably just get Quake 3
Jul 07 19:51:05 <emusan>	I love Quake 3
Jul 07 19:51:42 <emusan>	traeak, you could always use the accelerometer for looking ;)
Jul 07 19:51:50 <emusan>	its actually not the worst on n900
Jul 07 19:51:50 <traeak>	heh
Jul 07 19:51:55 <Exophase>	We need an accelerometer too ;p
Jul 07 19:52:09 <traeak>	should be cheap nowadays
Jul 07 19:52:11 <emusan>	I've actually managed to beat some levels of q3 with the shite controls on n900
Jul 07 19:52:14 <Exophase>	Yeah they are.
Jul 07 19:52:21 <emusan>	not as cheap as the wifi+bluetooth lol
Jul 07 19:52:24 <traeak>	i just want my n900 to stay charged :-p
Jul 07 19:52:29 <emusan>	I still think $.15 is insane
Jul 07 19:52:38 <emusan>	traeak, keep it plugged into the wall
Jul 07 19:52:38 <Exophase>	emusan; We'll see, I'm not holding my breath for any of these alleged prices.
Jul 07 19:52:40 <traeak>	.15 for what?
Jul 07 19:52:50 <Exophase>	traeak; Atheros 6102 wifi + BT module.. maybe.
Jul 07 19:53:05 <--	kutagh has quit (Quit: TTYL)
Jul 07 19:53:25 <traeak>	crap...i missed the part about how much power it sucks ?
Jul 07 19:53:36 <Exophase>	What, the track pad?
Jul 07 19:53:38 <traeak>	that's trash cheap
Jul 07 19:53:49 <traeak>	Exophase: the wifi module
Jul 07 19:54:21 <Exophase>	Where'd you see that it does?
Jul 07 19:54:47 <Exophase>	The thing is, ps2chiper says we should get SDIO over USB, but whatever we try we should prototype on the QSB first. That means finding something that's available in an SDIO card..
Jul 07 19:55:02 <traeak>	usb is power hungry from what i understand
Jul 07 19:55:22 <Exophase>	It's 5V so probably less efficient..

Jul 07 23:22:28 <Exophase>	Triverske; Hi
Jul 07 23:22:32 <Exophase>	I ordered some hardware today.
Jul 07 23:22:45 <Triverske>	What all did you get?
Jul 07 23:23:53 <Syniphas>	HI TRIVERSKE
Jul 07 23:23:56 *	Syniphas tacklehugs
Jul 07 23:24:00 <Triverske>	oh
Jul 07 23:24:03 <Triverske>	goodness
Jul 07 23:24:07 <Triverske>	hello Syniphas
Jul 07 23:24:12 <emusan>	ZOMG ITS TRIVERSKE
Jul 07 23:24:17 <emusan>	HIHIHI
Jul 07 23:24:24 <Syniphas>	:3
Jul 07 23:24:30 <Syniphas>	Triverske Triverske Triverske
Jul 07 23:24:31 <Triverske>	Guys c'mon, I come here every day
Jul 07 23:24:32 <Exophase>	The i.MX53 QSB, a Cortex-M3 board, some of those joysticks, some wires, a multimeter, and wire strippers.
Jul 07 23:24:33 <Syniphas>	i maded musics
Jul 07 23:24:33 <Syniphas>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9435923/music/kingsdecision.xm
Jul 07 23:25:25 <Triverske>	Exophase, that's good
Jul 07 23:25:50 <emusan>	I got my nubs in today..
Jul 07 23:25:56 <emusan>	Don't know if I told you...
Jul 07 23:25:58 <emusan>	they're tiny
Jul 07 23:26:01 <Exophase>	Don't call them nubs :C
Jul 07 23:26:05 <emusan>	true
Jul 07 23:26:06 <Triverske>	How tiny?
Jul 07 23:26:13 <emusan>	smaller than thumb
Jul 07 23:26:20 <Syniphas>	I'm gonna bleack my hair tomorrow and dye it blue
Jul 07 23:26:22 <emusan>	I can take some pics...
Jul 07 23:26:24 <Syniphas>	bleach*
Jul 07 23:26:29 <emusan>	why?
Jul 07 23:26:31 <Exophase>	emusan; You don't think they're too small, do you?
Jul 07 23:26:44 <Syniphas>	emusan: do I need a reason? :V
Jul 07 23:26:50 <Triverske>	I got my GP2X today, I've already bricked it, making it the 2nd fastest brick time for myself. 
Jul 07 23:27:08 <emusan>	not too small if we have good caps...
Jul 07 23:27:23 <emusan>	triverske an f200?
Jul 07 23:27:24 <Exophase>	Yeah, caps, that'll be the real work huh.
Jul 07 23:27:34 <Syniphas>	Triverske did you listen to my song :<
Jul 07 23:27:36 <Triverske>	F100 w/ breakout board
Jul 07 23:27:41 <emusan>	ah
Jul 07 23:27:50 <Exophase>	How did you brick it?
Jul 07 23:27:51 <Triverske>	and Syniphas, it's good, it's quite different from your other words
Jul 07 23:27:59 <Syniphas>	:3
Jul 07 23:28:07 <Triverske>	Exophase, I dunno, it pops up with random colors
Jul 07 23:28:19 <Triverske>	it'll start up every once in a while
Jul 07 23:28:21 <Exophase>	Oh well, GP2X F100 is a lame handheld IMO ;p
Jul 07 23:28:52 <Exophase>	Wiz is better in most ways..
Jul 07 23:28:59 <Triverske>	I'll probably use it embedded as something
Jul 07 23:29:24 <Exophase>	How much did it cost you?
Jul 07 23:29:39 <Exophase>	I have two.. one has a broken SD slot, the other has a broken USB
Jul 07 23:29:42 <emusan>	exophase, do you have a Wiz?
Jul 07 23:29:45 <Exophase>	Together they almost make a complete unit.
Jul 07 23:29:47 <Exophase>	emusan; Yeah
Jul 07 23:29:49 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 23:29:55 <Exophase>	I haven't turned it on in like 2 years, the GP2X probably longer
Jul 07 23:29:58 <emusan>	I almost got one...
Jul 07 23:30:22 <Exophase>	Mine is prerelease, received it in October 2008
Jul 07 23:31:19 <Exophase>	It's hardly my ideal handheld, I think the controls aren't that comfortable and of course it's not really that powerful.
Jul 07 23:31:48 <Exophase>	I didn't even bother trying to get a Caanoo, no point really..
Jul 07 23:33:06 <emusan>	what has been your favorite handheld so far?
Jul 07 23:33:10 <Exophase>	I guess my GP2X with the modded dpad is one of the better handhelds, but enh
Jul 07 23:33:23 <Exophase>	To be honest, I don't really care about any of these.
Jul 07 23:33:33 <Exophase>	Don't spend enough time away from a computer where I really want a handheld..
Jul 07 23:33:48 <Exophase>	But in terms of play time my PSP is the only one I've really used much...
Jul 07 23:33:54 <Exophase>	Pandora would potentially be the best choice for emulators.
Jul 07 23:33:56 <Exophase>	If I had an excuse to use it.
Jul 07 23:34:07 <Exophase>	My PSP I actually played a few GBA games on >_>
Jul 07 23:34:13 <Exophase>	And some NES ones before that..
Jul 07 23:34:49 <emusan>	I played through sonic on my DSL
Jul 07 23:34:58 <Exophase>	On jEnesisDS?
Jul 07 23:35:01 <emusan>	instead of paying attention in school lol
Jul 07 23:35:11 <emusan>	I think it was an earlier one...
Jul 07 23:35:16 <emusan>	just a sec...
Jul 07 23:35:22 <Triverske>	Exophase, I paid $50
Jul 07 23:35:30 <emusan>	I remember it couldn't do sound
Jul 07 23:35:31 <Exophase>	jEnesisDS was probably the only one worth using..
Jul 07 23:35:36 <Exophase>	Oh, huh >_>
Jul 07 23:35:44 <Exophase>	I was good friends with the author of that but I haven't seen him in a while.
Jul 07 23:36:04 <Triverske>	Exophase, Lameboy was always good
Jul 07 23:36:06 <Exophase>	If I manage to catch him I should ask if he's interested in working on the Triverske handheld in any form
Jul 07 23:36:17 <Exophase>	I wonder when Triverske handheld is going to get some kind of name.
Jul 07 23:36:20 <Exophase>	Even if just a codename.
Jul 07 23:36:23 <Exophase>	And we need a new channel.
Jul 07 23:36:28 <Triverske>	I gave it a name
Jul 07 23:36:28 <emusan>	I was friends with a lot of DS dev's, but I haven't really seen them in awhile
Jul 07 23:36:32 <Exophase>	What name?
Jul 07 23:36:34 <emusan>	only one I keep in touch with...
Jul 07 23:37:00 <Triverske>	I call it, eon
Jul 07 23:37:32 <Exophase>	I think one of the most important factors in a name is how unique it is. You want it to come up on the first page of a google search.
Jul 07 23:37:33 <Triverske>	or whatever I feel like
Jul 07 23:37:45 <Exophase>	Something Pandora fails at.
Jul 07 23:37:55 <Exophase>	Wait, no it doesn't.
Jul 07 23:37:59 <Exophase>	But still, not unique enough IMO
Jul 07 23:38:08 <Triverske>	Well Pandora radio is pretty big
Jul 07 23:38:19 <Exophase>	Yeah, and there's other stuff..
Jul 07 23:38:26 <Exophase>	Even with handhelds there was Pandora's battery for PSP..
Jul 07 23:38:35 <Triverske>	EON is mostly unclaimed territory
Jul 07 23:38:41 <Exophase>	Anyway, you can augment a name by adding to it, not necessarily replacing it.
Jul 07 23:38:50 <Triverske>	I suppose
Jul 07 23:38:57 <emusan>	why not iEON?
Jul 07 23:38:59 <Exophase>	But anything that's a word is going to hurt you off the bat.
Jul 07 23:39:10 <Exophase>	As opposed to a proper noun, acronym, etc
Jul 07 23:39:13 <Exophase>	emusan; Let's not :<
Jul 07 23:39:18 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 23:40:10 <Exophase>	Anyway it might not be that big of a deal
Jul 07 23:40:14 <Exophase>	Especially if it's not that mainstream.
Jul 07 23:40:39 <--	Mr_Gnome has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 07 23:40:51 <Exophase>	Triverske; I looked at that LCD more, in particular its pinout/connector
Jul 07 23:41:08 <Exophase>	Connector is standardish, and pinout is at the very least used in another LCD I look at it (from a different company)
Jul 07 23:41:09 <Triverske>	What did you find?
Jul 07 23:41:13 <Triverske>	Ah
Jul 07 23:41:27 <Exophase>	So it's probably pretty standard. It might even be used on the LCD daughter board for the QSB.
Jul 07 23:41:38 <Exophase>	But if it's not we'll have to make our own daughter board.
Jul 07 23:42:10 <emusan>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12994/20110707_004.jpg
Jul 07 23:42:14 <emusan>	theres the nubs
Jul 07 23:42:16 <emusan>	and a penny
Jul 07 23:42:24 <emusan>	I also have one with my sexy finger in it if you want...
Jul 07 23:42:36 <emusan>	it hurts to use them much lol
Jul 07 23:42:37 <Exophase>	Sticks.
Jul 07 23:42:43 <emusan>	sorry lol
Jul 07 23:42:46 <emusan>	force of habit
Jul 07 23:42:55 <Exophase>	Wow, those are small.
Jul 07 23:43:03 <emusan>	I've been doing real good till tonight...
Jul 07 23:43:06 <Exophase>	But we don't want anything too tall, so..
Jul 07 23:43:29 <Triverske>	are they well built?
Jul 07 23:43:37 <Exophase>	I have tiny hands so I'll probably be okay using these.
Jul 07 23:43:38 <emusan>	pretty solid
Jul 07 23:43:40 <emusan>	mostly metal
Jul 07 23:43:43 <Exophase>	Of course, you can't say anything about it without a cap.
Jul 07 23:43:57 <emusan>	they take significant amount of force
Jul 07 23:44:03 <emusan>	but thats due to small post lol
Jul 07 23:44:04 <emusan>	and the pain
Jul 07 23:44:22 <Exophase>	Yeah bare metal sticks are never supposed to be comfortable to push around.
Jul 07 23:44:28 <Exophase>	Like when my GP2X cap broke :/
Jul 07 23:44:35 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 23:44:36 <mib_o66b1e>	Emusan, I've read everything you've wrote. Nicely written
Jul 07 23:44:45 <emusan>	wrote where?
Jul 07 23:44:47 <emusan>	my site?
Jul 07 23:44:55 <mib_o66b1e>	"Where's the video, bob?"
Jul 07 23:45:07 <emusan>	lol I don't remember writing anything special...
Jul 07 23:45:19 <Triverske>	emusan is very knowlegeable
Jul 07 23:45:24 <mib_o66b1e>	But you've brought up some interesting points
Jul 07 23:45:28 <emusan>	NO HE ISN'T
Jul 07 23:45:31 <emusan>	ITS A LIE
Jul 07 23:46:02 <mib_o66b1e>	I don't see why he can't take "two" snapshots and just post it. Just for the people on the forums, no one else will see it.
Jul 07 23:46:13 <emusan>	oh yeah, that thread...
Jul 07 23:46:20 <mib_o66b1e>	Because he's worried about "getting the site popular to early" which puzzles me
Jul 07 23:46:23 <emusan>	hell he could do it for the people in irc...
Jul 07 23:46:31 <mib_o66b1e>	I agree
Jul 07 23:46:36 <mib_o66b1e>	To be honest
Jul 07 23:46:38 <mib_o66b1e>	10 dollars?
Jul 07 23:46:42 <Exophase>	So these caps, will they have a semi-spherical base like the kind you usually see on analog sticks, or will they just be the tops like on GP2X?
Jul 07 23:46:50 <mib_o66b1e>	Sounds way to good to be true...
Jul 07 23:47:02 <Triverske>	It is 
Jul 07 23:47:03 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e; Yeah we're pretty skeptical that the $10 price point can be reached.
Jul 07 23:47:19 <mib_o66b1e>	How the hell will he play his rent?
Jul 07 23:47:22 <emusan>	even $20
Jul 07 23:47:22 <mib_o66b1e>	lol
Jul 07 23:47:27 <Exophase>	How HAS he been paying his rent.
Jul 07 23:47:30 <emusan>	lol
Jul 07 23:47:33 <mib_o66b1e>	Lollllll
Jul 07 23:47:50 <mib_o66b1e>	But just one photo
Jul 07 23:47:57 <emusan>	he lives off people wanting his stuff
Jul 07 23:47:59 <Exophase>	I believe his intentions to sell the thing at cost, but his investors will never go for that. Especially when the app store barely makes revenue.
Jul 07 23:48:06 <emusan>	he sells gamer tears on the black market...
Jul 07 23:48:22 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e, I want to say he has nothing very interesting to show. He probably bought an off the shelf eval board and ported his stuff to that.
Jul 07 23:48:41 <mib_o66b1e>	I never understood how the appstore would work?
Jul 07 23:48:49 <Exophase>	Like any other app store.
Jul 07 23:48:59 <mib_o66b1e>	It's quite confusing. Like will you have a desktop application?
Jul 07 23:49:01 <Exophase>	But with more profit for the authors.
Jul 07 23:49:02 <emusan>	except he takes a huge cut...
Jul 07 23:49:09 <emusan>	more profit?
Jul 07 23:49:16 <mib_o66b1e>	So like a desktop application?
Jul 07 23:49:17 <Exophase>	emusan; Yes, Bob says he's only skimming 10%.
Jul 07 23:49:26 <Exophase>	While on iOS and Android they take 30%.
Jul 07 23:49:28 <emusan>	doesn't android skim 0?
Jul 07 23:49:31 <emusan>	oh
Jul 07 23:49:36 <emusan>	SlideMe doesn't take any lol
Jul 07 23:49:38 <emusan>	I liek them
Jul 07 23:49:42 <mib_o66b1e>	Android doesn't take 30%?
Jul 07 23:49:49 <mib_o66b1e>	apple does
Jul 07 23:49:53 <Exophase>	If you think about it, for developers 90% vs 70% isn't THAT much. Especially when iOS and Android will certainly be much, much larger in marketshare.
Jul 07 23:49:57 <emusan>	I thought Android was just $25 to publish apps...
Jul 07 23:49:59 <Exophase>	Android takes 30%.
Jul 07 23:50:13 <emusan>	and not to mention sales on this will be small...
Jul 07 23:50:26 <mib_o66b1e>	Apple is a bunch of ripoffs anyways
Jul 07 23:50:28 <emusan>	unless he actually sells "millions"
Jul 07 23:50:45 <mib_o66b1e>	10 dollars?\
Jul 07 23:50:49 <mib_o66b1e>	Hm
Jul 07 23:50:52 <mib_o66b1e>	I'll think about that
Jul 07 23:51:08 <mib_o66b1e>	I wouldn't sell my t-shirt for 10 dollars...
Jul 07 23:51:10 <Exophase>	"Application developers receive 70% of the application price, with the remaining 30% distributed among carriers and payment processors (Google does not take a percentage)."
Jul 07 23:51:24 <mib_o66b1e>	If I paid 10 dollars ot make something, I would expect some kind of profit.
Jul 07 23:51:24 <Exophase>	So it doesn't go to Google. I don't know how Google makes money on Android, probably license costs to the carriers.
Jul 07 23:51:28 <emusan>	ah
Jul 07 23:51:35 <Exophase>	Anyway, I think 70% to 90% isn't some huge incentive.
Jul 07 23:51:42 <Triverske>	mib_o66b1e, if he wanted to sell it for $10 it would be at an extreme loss
Jul 07 23:51:43 <Exophase>	On the other hand, 30% to 10% is a drastic drop in profits.
Jul 07 23:51:46 <Exophase>	That'll already be too thin.
Jul 07 23:52:10 <Exophase>	There have to be what, tens of millions of sales on the app store for this to be financially viable to investors?
Jul 07 23:52:26 <mib_o66b1e>	That's exactly what I'm saying
Jul 07 23:52:32 <mib_o66b1e>	It's a bit odd
Jul 07 23:52:54 <Exophase>	He obviously won't sell it for a loss. He said he expects the first run to be over $10, which is why he's selling it with Bob's Game at $20 to absorb it.
Jul 07 23:52:57 <mib_o66b1e>	Exophase, would the appstore be like an application?
Jul 07 23:53:00 <Exophase>	But he can't sell it at a loss because he doesn't have money to.
Jul 07 23:53:02 <mib_o66b1e>	on your desktop?
Jul 07 23:53:18 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e; He hasn't been totally clear about that. He said you have to plug it into the app store to charge it (???)
Jul 07 23:53:26 <mib_o66b1e>	lol
Jul 07 23:53:36 <emusan>	I think he redacted that
Jul 07 23:53:37 <Exophase>	It has wifi so it'd be totally inane to make it so it can't interface the app store itself, but who knows.
Jul 07 23:53:43 <emusan>	he said it would charge in car chargeres
Jul 07 23:53:45 <Exophase>	Yeah I think he says a lot of stuff that he changes his mind on.
Jul 07 23:53:52 <Exophase>	Or just contradicts other stuff he says.
Jul 07 23:53:59 <mib_o66b1e>	lol
Jul 07 23:54:09 <mib_o66b1e>	Bob's game looks pretty cool though
Jul 07 23:54:18 <mib_o66b1e>	But it seems no one played it
Jul 07 23:54:18 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e; Have you played demo 2?
Jul 07 23:54:27 <mib_o66b1e>	Nope
Jul 07 23:54:28 <Exophase>	That demo that almost no one has.
Jul 07 23:54:28 <mib_o66b1e>	videos
Jul 07 23:54:44 <Exophase>	Maybe someone can send it to you (I don't think I have it, hard drive crash, sorry)
Jul 07 23:54:58 <Exophase>	It's a pretty frustrating and vapid demo ;p
Jul 07 23:55:02 <Exophase>	IMO
Jul 07 23:55:09 <mib_o66b1e>	I use ubuntu anyways, may not even run
Jul 07 23:55:19 <Exophase>	It runs on Wine, that's how I ran it.
Jul 07 23:55:25 <mib_o66b1e>	:O
Jul 07 23:55:27 <[]J>	I've seen the lets play of the whole demo <#:)
Jul 07 23:55:34 <Exophase>	Oh god
Jul 07 23:55:36 <Exophase>	That let's play is terrible.
Jul 07 23:55:40 <Exophase>	It's worse than playing it yourself.
Jul 07 23:55:43 <[]J>	in which bob has you sit through a guy saying "haha" for like 60 pages
Jul 07 23:55:52 <Exophase>	That guy being Bob
Jul 07 23:55:57 <Exophase>	Pretty fitting.
Jul 07 23:56:02 <[]J>	laughing directly at the player
Jul 07 23:56:16 <emusan>	I only ever played one
Jul 07 23:56:24 <emusan>	I didn't really like it that much tbh...
Jul 07 23:56:33 <emusan>	it was good for a homebrew but he wanted to sell it...
Jul 07 23:56:37 <mib_o66b1e>	If the appstore is a desktop application, it better work on ubuntu ...
Jul 07 23:56:46 <emusan>	it would
Jul 07 23:56:47 <emusan>	if it is
Jul 07 23:56:52 <emusan>	if it ever will be
Jul 07 23:57:01 <Triverske>	Exophase, you played demo 2?
Jul 07 23:57:02 <mib_o66b1e>	I mean, he did create a website
Jul 07 23:57:16 <Exophase>	Triverske; yes
Jul 07 23:57:21 <Exophase>	Someone here gave it to me.
Jul 07 23:57:29 <Exophase>	Can't remember who, sorry.
Jul 07 23:57:31 <mib_o66b1e>	Well, I found the bob's game
Jul 07 23:57:32 <mib_o66b1e>	demo
Jul 07 23:57:49 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e; Good luck finding demo 2, Bob did his best to purge it from the internet..
Jul 07 23:57:56 <mib_o66b1e>	Lol
Jul 07 23:57:57 <Exophase>	Even that Let's Play was pulled from Youtube..
Jul 07 23:58:13 <Triverske>	I would check with several people on the forums
Jul 07 23:58:15 <mib_o66b1e>	I don't want to play it though, just in case the nd comes, I want something to play
Jul 07 23:58:26 <Exophase>	mib_o66b1e; It's just a demo, not like it's that long.
Jul 07 23:58:36 <emusan>	dcemu's changed
Jul 07 23:58:40 <emusan>	lol haven't been there in YEARS
Jul 07 23:58:40 <Exophase>	Still, better not to turn yourself off from wanting to play it >_>
Jul 07 23:58:41 <mib_o66b1e>	Ohh
Jul 07 23:58:50 <mib_o66b1e>	True
Jul 07 23:59:42 <mib_o66b1e>	Bob is weird how. How could you talk so poorly about Nintendo in your game and expect them to publish it?
Jul 08 00:00:06 <emusan>	he only did the nintendo stuff after they "refused"
Jul 08 00:00:12 <Exophase>	It's hard to know what he's really being serious about.
Jul 08 00:00:13 <emusan>	but most people think he didn't even ask
Jul 08 00:00:16 <emusan>	myself included
Jul 08 00:00:22 <Exophase>	I think he's actually pretty serious though.
Jul 08 00:00:25 <Exophase>	Just exaggerated.
Jul 08 00:00:36 <emusan>	exophase, where do you get homebrew newses?
Jul 08 00:00:37 <Exophase>	emusan; Nintendo themselves said they rejected him.
Jul 08 00:00:41 <emusan>	I don't like new dcemu....
Jul 08 00:00:49 <emusan>	exophase orly, didn't know that lol
Jul 08 00:00:51 <Exophase>	I haven't been to dcemu in forever. I don't care about homebrew on anything really ;p
Jul 08 00:01:07 <Exophase>	They said he didn't meet their criteria, which of course everyone knew.
Jul 08 00:01:15 <Exophase>	I heard that his submission was very unprofessional.
Jul 08 00:01:23 <Exophase>	Like, having lolcats in it or something.
Jul 08 00:01:30 <emusan>	lol
Jul 08 00:01:33 <emusan>	not surprising
Jul 08 00:01:36 <Triverske>	before he stated acting like an idiot people were on his side.
Jul 08 00:01:58 <Exophase>	When I was questioning/criticizing him here he retorted saying I was "butthurt" ;p
Jul 08 00:02:10 <emusan>	rofl
Jul 08 00:02:19 <Exophase>	Well, not criticizing him, rather the nD
Jul 08 00:02:21 <mib_o66b1e>	LOL
Jul 08 00:02:38 <Exophase>	And he said that he's sure I really just want it to succeed..
Jul 08 00:02:48 <emusan>	mib_o66b1e are you on the forums?
Jul 08 00:02:53 <emusan>	like signed up...
Jul 08 00:02:54 <Exophase>	And that he didn't understand why anyone would stand against nD when it stands to benefit them so much.
Jul 08 00:02:59 <Exophase>	He's uh, a little full of himself. Just a little.
Jul 08 00:03:13 <emusan>	lol yeah...
Jul 08 00:03:25 <emusan>	he's mentioned the benifiting everyone a few times...
Jul 08 00:03:32 <emusan>	it hasn't done much of anything yet...
Jul 08 00:03:45 <emusan>	other than get us and Triverske together for this other, better console lol
Jul 08 00:03:49 <mib_o66b1e>	Yeah, he did sound a little full of himself. He reminds me of Notch for some reason
Jul 08 00:03:50 <Triverske>	(From the bob's game description)
Jul 08 00:03:50 <Triverske>	It is the brainchild of Robert Pelloni, a reclusive, self-taught 27 year old game maker "prodigy."
Jul 08 00:03:50 <Exophase>	emusan; http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/04/02/nintendo-finally-comments-on-bobs-game/
Jul 08 00:04:04 <Exophase>	I would say you really, really can't compare eon to nD
Jul 08 00:04:11 <Exophase>	If both really come to exist they'll be night and day
Jul 08 00:04:49 <Exophase>	I was thinking today, if eon will threaten Pandora and how.. but I think Pandora's demand vastly outstrips its supply ability, you just can't really threaten it.
Jul 08 00:05:06 <Exophase>	But moreover, the platforms are similar enough that I'm hoping there'll be an overarching software ecosystem between the two.
Jul 08 00:05:26 <emusan>	agree'd
Jul 08 00:05:53 <Exophase>	Where people do software for both a lot, and it increases the overall software base.
Jul 08 00:06:32 <Exophase>	This console is actually a LOT like Odroid when you get down to it.
Jul 08 00:06:42 <mib_o66b1e>	Lmao, he protested in his room?
Jul 08 00:06:43 <mib_o66b1e>	LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Jul 08 00:06:44 <emusan>	they did open source their OS right?
Jul 08 00:06:45 <Exophase>	But that ended up in such pitiful volume, and if the controls suck it's really dead in the water.
Jul 08 00:06:56 <emusan>	never heard of Odroid...
Jul 08 00:06:57 <Exophase>	emusan; It's Linux, no real choice.
Jul 08 00:07:06 <Exophase>	Will be same here, just as well though, Triverske is pretty pro-open
Jul 08 00:07:15 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 08 00:07:24 <emusan>	I know they decided to close some stuff up...
Jul 08 00:07:27 <emusan>	hardware, etc.
Jul 08 00:07:31 <emusan>	to keep out competition
Jul 08 00:07:32 <Triverske>	There is only one thing with DRM on the EON
Jul 08 00:07:32 <Exophase>	Actually, one thing - I haven't confirmed this but I THINK i.MX53 has open GPU drivers where IMG stuff on TI doesn't.
Jul 08 00:07:43 <Exophase>	Also, it might have proper OpenGL support, not just ES
Jul 08 00:07:50 <emusan>	really?
Jul 08 00:07:54 <emusan>	full OpenGL?
Jul 08 00:07:56 <Exophase>	But it also might be really buggy and low performance, I haven't gathered a lot of concrete info :/
Jul 08 00:07:57 <emusan>	that would be HUGE
Jul 08 00:08:05 <Exophase>	I'll tell you more when I have it.
Jul 08 00:08:11 <emusan>	okay....
Jul 08 00:08:20 <emusan>	whats the one thing with drm Triverske?
Jul 08 00:08:21 <Exophase>	Don't expect miracles from this GPU, I think it'll only be slightly more powerful than what's in the Pandora.
Jul 08 00:08:32 <emusan>	thats still pretty good...
Jul 08 00:08:46 <emusan>	lol could we get dreamcast you think?
Jul 08 00:09:10 <Exophase>	If that.
Jul 08 00:09:10 <Exophase>	I just hope it can do N64, is all.
Jul 08 00:09:10 <Exophase>	If you look at Adreno 200 in older Snapdragon's..
Jul 08 00:09:10 <Exophase>	Like in the old Nexus One.
Jul 08 00:09:10 <Exophase>	Same GPU, but I was able to determine that's at 125MHz.
Jul 08 00:09:16 <emusan>	I know EvilDragon said in some video it /might/ be possible on pandora with dynamic recompiling...
Jul 08 00:09:19 <Exophase>	This is 200MHz, so you can scale accordingly.
Jul 08 00:09:27 <Exophase>	Don't hold your breath for Dreamcast.
Jul 08 00:09:28 <Triverske>	emusan, I've got someone looking into an app store like system
Jul 08 00:09:28 <emusan>	wow just had super lag
Jul 08 00:09:43 <emusan>	I don't like drm :(
Jul 08 00:09:48 <Exophase>	However, afaik drk||Raziel didn't get a Pandora
Jul 08 00:09:49 <emusan>	it always ends up screwing me
Jul 08 00:10:00 <Exophase>	And ended up doing nullDCe dev for Android..
Jul 08 00:10:18 <Exophase>	I'll talk to him sometime I guess, if this gets anywhere.
Jul 08 00:10:30 <Exophase>	What I want is Nintendo DS :/
Jul 08 00:10:38 <Triverske>	emusan, if it has an app store, then I'll be able to charge less than $199
Jul 08 00:10:38 <emusan>	I have one...
Jul 08 00:10:40 <emusan>	why don't you?
Jul 08 00:10:53 <emusan>	thats true... assuming people use it...
Jul 08 00:11:02 <Exophase>	What I want is Nintendo DS emulation.
Jul 08 00:11:06 <emusan>	oh
Jul 08 00:11:11 <emusan>	that may be possible
Jul 08 00:11:13 <Exophase>	I had one, I broke it, but that's not relevant
Jul 08 00:11:14 <Triverske>	That would be big
Jul 08 00:11:17 <mib_o66b1e>	Good luck finding that
Jul 08 00:11:22 <mib_o66b1e>	:O
Jul 08 00:11:25 <emusan>	lol n900 has one
Jul 08 00:11:32 <emusan>	I think I can get like 5 fps in some games
Jul 08 00:11:33 <Exophase>	Most likely your best shot at DS emulation is from me :/
Jul 08 00:11:34 <Triverske>	A ds emulator?
Jul 08 00:11:37 <emusan>	I haven't tried it in forever
Jul 08 00:11:48 <emusan>	why the long face exophase?
Jul 08 00:11:49 <Exophase>	I was working on one up until a year ago..
Jul 08 00:11:59 <emusan>	:(
Jul 08 00:12:00 <Exophase>	Only on PC, but it has a recompiler.
Jul 08 00:12:10 <Exophase>	Not sure I should even say that here.
Jul 08 00:12:17 <emusan>	why not?
Jul 08 00:12:27 <Exophase>	It's not supposed to be public knowledge, I hate revealing things prematurely.
Jul 08 00:12:33 <emusan>	same...
Jul 08 00:12:49 <Exophase>	Anyway, I was working on the 3D, software rendering because I don't think OpenGL is really good enough in terms of accuracy for it.
Jul 08 00:13:02 <Exophase>	Lately I've been doing a NEON-based renderer for PS1
Jul 08 00:13:07 <Exophase>	To help improve speed there.
Jul 08 00:13:14 <Treeki>	the DS 3D hardware is fucked up
Jul 08 00:13:15 <Exophase>	But my harddrive crashed and I lost some work :/
Jul 08 00:13:17 <Exophase>	Need to get back on that.
Jul 08 00:13:24 <Triverske>	Call it ExophaseDS
Jul 08 00:13:31 <Exophase>	It already has a name, and that isn't it ;p
Jul 08 00:13:36 <Treeki>	it's like the GBA's GPU meets some primitive 3D chip from decades ago
Jul 08 00:13:47 <Exophase>	It's not like I barely got anywhere on it, this thing played a lot of commercial games, had sound.
Jul 08 00:13:58 <emusan>	I remember doing ds graphics programming...
Jul 08 00:14:01 <emusan>	only 2d though
Jul 08 00:14:01 <Exophase>	Treeki; Be that as it may, it's more complex than PS1
Jul 08 00:14:07 <emusan>	I was and still am scared of 3d
Jul 08 00:14:26 <Treeki>	I did a bit of reversing on the 3D model system in Mario 64 DS (with gbatek's help)
Jul 08 00:14:35 <Treeki>	and I've looked at the graphics library in the SDK
Jul 08 00:14:39 <Treeki>	neither of them are pretty
Jul 08 00:14:40 <Triverske>	Exophase, that's quite an accomplishment
Jul 08 00:14:50 <mib_o66b1e>	Are you all game designers?
Jul 08 00:15:00 <Treeki>	GX used in the GC/Wii is fairly similar to OpenGL, but the DS GPU is just... weird
Jul 08 00:15:01 <emusan>	developers...
Jul 08 00:15:06 <emusan>	designers can draw lol
Jul 08 00:15:09 <Exophase>	I actually did a scene capturer for DS games, and a DS program to step through it.
Jul 08 00:15:11 <Treeki>	I'm a game hacker
Jul 08 00:15:15 <Exophase>	That helps for writing an emulator.
Jul 08 00:15:18 <Exophase>	But I broke my DS ;p
Jul 08 00:15:21 <mib_o66b1e>	Oh sorry lol. I'm just a game player
Jul 08 00:15:30 <Exophase>	I have a lot to reverse engineer for the gritty details of DS 3D, that no one knows right now.
Jul 08 00:15:41 <Treeki>	gbatek is no help?
Jul 08 00:15:44 <Exophase>	Reversing this stuff is extremely difficult.
Jul 08 00:15:46 <emusan>	mib_o66b1e it doesn't really matter...
Jul 08 00:15:53 <Exophase>	Treeki; I'm talking grittier. Internal precision sort of thing.
Jul 08 00:15:58 <Exophase>	The stuff you need to attempt pixel perfect rendering.
Jul 08 00:16:13 <Exophase>	None of the PS1 GPUs are pixel perfect for instance (except mine >_<)
Jul 08 00:16:16 <Exophase>	And PS1 is a lot simpler.
Jul 08 00:16:20 <mib_o66b1e>	Oh ok
Jul 08 00:16:41 <Exophase>	But if you make something pixel perfect it makes it a lot more straightforward to debug.
Jul 08 00:16:42 <Triverske>	What was the first emulation related thing you worked on Exophase?
Jul 08 00:16:45 <emusan>	mib_o66b1e you prolly just wont understand some stuff lol
Jul 08 00:16:51 <Exophase>	Triverske; gpSP for the most part
Jul 08 00:17:08 <Treeki>	I haven't tried writing an emulator or anything like that yet
Jul 08 00:17:08 <emusan>	which is EVERYWHERE now
Jul 08 00:17:10 <Exophase>	Not counting little optimization tasks I had for other people's PS1 emulators a bazillion years ago, or that dynarec I did for a toy arch in college.
Jul 08 00:17:45 <mib_o66b1e>	Yeah, I'm quite lost lol
Jul 08 00:18:17 <emusan>	Treeki, I have no intention of doing so any time soon either
Jul 08 00:18:22 <emusan>	that stuff is black magic
Jul 08 00:18:46 <Exophase>	Ugh, I wish I was more productive :/ So much unfinished stuff I need to get back to..
Jul 08 00:18:53 <Triverske>	also #eon should be our new hangout
Jul 08 00:18:57 <Exophase>	I really need to do that this weekend.
Jul 08 00:19:01 <Exophase>	Triverske; Alright.

Jul 08 07:05:45 <ps2chiper>	sounds fun, how is the controller interface setup?
Jul 08 07:06:20 <[]J>	controller :1
Jul 08 07:06:34 <[]J>	mouse + keyboard, you can map the keys however you want
Jul 08 07:07:03 <[]J>	www.homph.com/QC.png think you've seen the screen shot before
Jul 08 07:07:04 <ps2chiper>	do you plan on an android and iphone port?
Jul 08 07:07:15 <[]J>	I think you asked that before too <#:)
Jul 08 07:07:31 <[]J>	too much is going on on the screen, and the controls are too fine
Jul 08 07:07:33 <[]J>	it wouldn't work as one
Jul 08 07:07:57 <[]J>	my next project is going to be a casual (with hidden depth...) roguelike, which will be targeting average sized android phones
Jul 08 07:08:15 <ps2chiper>	I see the image, the graphics are rough, but i guess that adds to the charm
Jul 08 07:08:45 <[]J>	no choice, no dough for an artist
Jul 08 07:08:49 <[]J>	or, a proper artist, rather
Jul 08 07:10:34 <ps2chiper>	how do you plan on porting it to the nD?
Jul 08 07:11:20 <[]J>	the roguelike?
Jul 08 07:11:38 <[]J>	dunno, I'll make it work somehow if it does come out :/
Jul 08 07:12:06 <ps2chiper>	You can port it to dingux

Jul 08 07:38:28 <ps2chiper>	Does anyone here like dc comics
Jul 08 07:39:00 <[]J>	I liked watchmen, and that's about it <#:)
Jul 08 07:40:48 <ps2chiper>	I was reading the new power girl comics, and now she lives in new york, I cant tell if they moved the jsa to earth prime or new york is now part of earth 1
Jul 08 07:43:53 <ps2chiper>	ok, I found out they rebooted earth 2
Jul 08 07:43:59 <ps2chiper>	and its called new earth now

Jul 08 10:10:56 <Triverske>	how cheap?
Jul 08 10:12:11 <ps2chiper>	a few rmb
Jul 08 10:12:17 <ps2chiper>	like 4 rmb for each nub
Jul 08 10:12:48 <Triverske>	Ah, well if these don't meet our expectations, that's a definite second option
Jul 08 10:14:26 <Triverske>	also, ps2chiper, #eon is going to be our new discussion place

Jul 09 11:22:59 <Exophase>	This whole "16-bit" thing is really confusing everyone.
Jul 09 11:23:39 <ps2chiper>	yeah, nd is 2d and eon is 3d
Jul 09 11:24:12 <Exophase>	Bob is just nostalgia whoring the "16-bit games" thing, I'd be surprised if even the LCD is 16-bit like he says..
Jul 09 11:24:45 <ps2chiper>	also it shows him online the forum, but he wont post
Jul 09 11:25:31 <Exophase>	I doubt he has much useful to say right now.
Jul 09 11:27:16 <ps2chiper>	Then he should just hand over the keys to his website so someone more competent can take over
Jul 09 11:28:12 <Exophase>	Why would someone else have something useful to say?
Jul 09 11:28:27 <ps2chiper>	You would
Jul 09 11:28:28 <Exophase>	What is it he isn't doing that you think he should be?
Jul 09 11:28:43 <beoran>	it's his game, let him play it :)
Jul 09 11:28:51 <Exophase>	No, I have nothing useful to say about nD, I imagine right now there isn't that much useful either.. I don't think promoting his dev setup is that useful for instance.
Jul 09 11:28:54 <Exophase>	beoran; Hey
Jul 09 11:28:59 <Exophase>	Haven't heard from you in a while :B
Jul 09 11:29:00 <beoran>	and we'll play ours :)
Jul 09 11:29:07 <beoran>	I lurked a bit
Jul 09 11:29:09 <ps2chiper>	hey
Jul 09 11:30:10 <beoran>	Personaly I hate vaporare, so I'd never advertise widely with something that's not at least basically usable/playable/has a working prototype. 
Jul 09 11:30:27 <Exophase>	I agree, although if you need to solicit for help that's something else.
Jul 09 11:30:33 <Exophase>	But keep it discrete/modest
Jul 09 11:30:38 <Exophase>	Not hype.
Jul 09 11:31:02 <beoran>	Exophase: sure, but in that case, you still better have enough of a project so others can actually help you.
Jul 09 11:31:03 <ps2chiper>	I dont know, he has the publicity now. it would be a shame to let it go to waist
Jul 09 11:31:15 <Exophase>	nD is ridiculous, Bob is like "we're releasing a $10 handheld!" and everyone is like "OMG that's amazing!" and they're like "just got to make a $10 handheld now."
Jul 09 11:31:22 <beoran>	wel, if the eon happens, at least something good came from it :)
Jul 09 11:31:32 <Exophase>	Getting a few hundred people online excited isn't worth anything.
Jul 09 11:31:46 <ps2chiper>	It was on lxer
Jul 09 11:31:49 <ps2chiper>	twice
Jul 09 11:32:28 <Exophase>	Okay, then put it this way, getting people excited on a premise that hinges entirely on something you haven't accomplished and probably can't accomplish isn't worth anything either.
Jul 09 11:32:33 <beoran>	wel, maybe, in 5 or 10 years time th component prices will realy be low enough to make it. 
Jul 09 11:32:45 <ps2chiper>	well he is a dick in that regard
Jul 09 11:32:51 <beoran>	But now, it's not possible, no. 
Jul 09 11:33:02 <ps2chiper>	actually i think prices bottom out
Jul 09 11:33:21 <ps2chiper>	prices arnt going to get cheaper from today, they will get more expensive
Jul 09 11:33:27 <beoran>	ps2chiper: I have that feeling too as of lately, but it may be the worldwide banking crisis
Jul 09 11:33:34 <Exophase>	Yes, there's a point of diminishing returns where it makes more sense to go better than cheaper.
Jul 09 11:33:37 <Exophase>	Look at harddrive prices for instance.
Jul 09 11:33:43 <ps2chiper>	you have the devaluation of the dollar and the rise of the rmb
Jul 09 11:33:45 <Exophase>	You can't buy a 1GB harddrive for 1 cent or whatever.
Jul 09 11:34:30 <beoran>	sure, and the "miracle" o china is going to run out of stem in this and 10 years. Then India will come, but... 
Jul 09 11:34:44 <ps2chiper>	india wont come
Jul 09 11:34:52 <beoran>	really? 
Jul 09 11:35:09 <ps2chiper>	india never developed a manufacturing base
Jul 09 11:35:21 <ps2chiper>	I was trying to get a blog about it going 3 months ago
Jul 09 11:35:55 <beoran>	really? interesting
Jul 09 11:36:11 <beoran>	we don't havemuch of a manufacturing base left in Europe either, though...
Jul 09 11:36:47 <ps2chiper>	You have to put in perspective that the chinese government pushed manufacturing. they created the chain of parts
Jul 09 11:37:02 <ps2chiper>	actually right now, the labor is cheaper in india
Jul 09 11:37:11 <ps2chiper>	also they have more english speakers and software programmers
Jul 09 11:37:24 <beoran>	ps2chiper: sure, the chinese wanted to become the factory of the world. 
Jul 09 11:37:33 <ps2chiper>	but you can talk to any indian online and they wont know jack about manufacturing
Jul 09 11:37:48 <ps2chiper>	well the indian government doesnt
Jul 09 11:38:10 <ps2chiper>	also their is no train that connects india to china
Jul 09 11:38:25 <beoran>	ps2chiper: I think the caste stsyem that still lingesr is the problem there: manual labour is not really seen as positive, perhaps?
Jul 09 11:38:27 <ps2chiper>	so how are you going to get all the manufacturing equipment to india and all the parts
Jul 09 11:38:39 <ps2chiper>	airmail and boat?
Jul 09 11:38:41 <beoran>	ps2chiper: by boat
Jul 09 11:38:53 <beoran>	they shpped most of europe's factories to china by boat
Jul 09 11:39:03 <ps2chiper>	you should bring up a map of the sea routes of china to india
Jul 09 11:39:07 <beoran>	bota is relatively cheap
Jul 09 11:39:11 <ps2chiper>	and then look at the topography of land
Jul 09 11:39:18 <ps2chiper>	no its the time required
Jul 09 11:39:30 <ps2chiper>	manufacturing is all about speed
Jul 09 11:39:32 <beoran>	the boats to china /passed/ india... :)
Jul 09 11:39:40 <beoran>	at least coming from europe
Jul 09 11:39:43 <ps2chiper>	you cant wait 2 months on a part
Jul 09 11:40:07 <beoran>	in Europe manufacturing was never that speedy, you know
Jul 09 11:40:19 <ps2chiper>	You cant wait 2 months on a replacement press, for manufacturing shipping parts by boat is too slow
Jul 09 11:40:35 <ps2chiper>	thats also the situation in vietnam
Jul 09 11:40:35 <beoran>	I waite more than 2 months for parts of the obot I'm currently programming at my day job...
Jul 09 11:40:41 <ps2chiper>	brb
Jul 09 11:40:53 <Exophase>	I want to program a robot.
Jul 09 11:41:02 <Exophase>	It could keep me company.
Jul 09 11:41:07 <beoran>	big machines are genearrly repaired, no t replaced.
Jul 09 11:41:18 <beoran>	Exophase: unfortunatly, it's a "portal robot"
Jul 09 11:41:28 <Exophase>	What's that?
Jul 09 11:41:32 <beoran>	absolutely not humanoid in shape
Jul 09 11:41:55 <Exophase>	I could be friends with a non-humanoid.
Jul 09 11:42:00 <beoran>	it has a claw to manpulate things, but it moves uses a 3 axis beam, gear and belt system
Jul 09 11:42:16 <Exophase>	For automation?
Jul 09 11:45:47 <ps2chiper>	ok, well this conversation has little to do with reality 
Jul 09 11:45:57 <ps2chiper>	if you want a robot check out the hexapod
Jul 09 11:47:24 <Exophase>	What?
Jul 09 11:47:36 <Exophase>	Which conversation has little to do with reality?
Jul 09 11:47:47 <ps2chiper>	its an avr based bug robot
Jul 09 11:47:48 <Exophase>	I'm not serious about wanting a robot, but I am interested in talking to beoran about what he does at work.
Jul 09 11:48:11 <ps2chiper>	its beoran's take on manufacturing
Jul 09 11:48:32 <Exophase>	'kay
Jul 09 11:48:35 <Exophase>	I think that one ended ;p

Jul 09 11:53:41 <Exophase>	No one calls Android Linux, I think that's kind of a foregone conclusion.

Jul 09 11:55:39 <Exophase>	Hm, good link to Alien Dalvik, I wonder how that works on Ubuntu.. maybe I should try it.
Jul 09 11:55:53 <Exophase>	Or if it's meant for Windows or something :/
Jul 09 11:58:20 <ps2chiper>	How do you guys feel about those mdf MAME cabinets 
Jul 09 11:58:24 <Exophase>	MeeGo first I guess..
Jul 09 11:58:41 <Exophase>	And Maemo
Jul 09 12:02:22 <beoran>	Exophase: some people are less cool with what we're doing... we modify the genes of the plants to make them more drought resistant... in urope GM has a bad name, mostly because of the "green religion" as I call it.
Jul 09 12:02:53 <Exophase>	I can see why people would at least be anxious about it, if they're concerned about negative side-effects.
Jul 09 12:03:04 <Exophase>	But I guess those who don't like "playing god" are another story.
Jul 09 12:04:00 <ps2chiper>	See if you can plant them in the gobi desert to stop the sand storms

Jul 12 13:00:01 <andermetalsh>	I have a question, will the nD have an option to load homebrew games (GPL ones) from an SD card or from USB storage ?
Jul 12 13:00:37 <JosJuice>	I'm pretty sure that you can transfer such games to it using micro-USB.
Jul 12 13:05:04 <andermetalsh>	oh thanks , I though the only option was with some online repo/channel with the help of a wireless, connection . Nice .

Jul 12 21:37:27 <Triverske>	what did he do this time?
Jul 12 21:37:32 <Triverske>	The PC market?
Jul 12 21:37:59 <emusan>	are you referring to the whole he doesn't have enough resources to publish on PC []Java?
Jul 12 21:38:21 <[]Java>	just read this http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=145&pid=1732#pid1732
Jul 12 21:38:40 <[]Java>	oh, looks like if I kept reading down I would have seen what you referred to

Jul 12 21:38:55 <emusan>	lol I don't get how he has the resources to make a whole console
Jul 12 21:38:58 <emusan>	if he can't publish

Jul 12 21:40:25 <[]Java>	hehe

Jul 12 21:41:18 <emusan>	= free
Jul 12 21:41:31 <emusan>	lol I think Bob has advertising covered
Jul 12 21:41:58 <Triverske>	He's okay at that
Jul 12 21:42:00 <emusan>	and if the game is written in SDL, it should take no time porting it. Right Bob?
Jul 12 21:42:13 <emusan>	oh right, its not always that simple is it?
Jul 12 21:42:14 <[]Java>	he already made a PC version
Jul 12 21:42:19 <[]Java>	for the demo

Jul 12 21:42:48 <[]Java>	"the PC market is fantastic, but it's become too high-end and the only way to compete is to write a FPS using unreal engine. "
Jul 12 21:42:48 <[]Java>	lol

Jul 13 22:08:42 <MarvinDalkiri>	lazy mode ON
Jul 13 22:09:46 <[]J>	make a micro game and worse case you can zoom it and sell it on pc / phones
Jul 13 22:09:52 <[]J>	not like the nD has to be the end all
Jul 13 22:10:33 <[]J>	as long as you separate graphics/logic you're golden for porting <#:)
Jul 13 22:14:20 <MarvinDalkiri>	yeah, i know
Jul 13 22:14:25 <MarvinDalkiri>	i was thinking about it too
Jul 13 22:14:41 <MarvinDalkiri>	anyway, in the worst case scenario, i can still make millions on steam :D
Jul 13 22:14:49 <emusan>	lol but []J publishing on the PC takes a lot of resources
Jul 13 22:14:56 <emusan>	more than making a whole new console

Jul 14 00:08:12 <SicariusVelox>	hello [ ] J
Jul 14 00:08:13 <[]J>	emusan what OS are you on?
Jul 14 00:08:23 <emusan>	Win7
Jul 14 00:08:27 <[]J>	ah
Jul 14 00:08:33 <emusan>	but I use Linux in a VM a lot
Jul 14 00:08:35 <emusan>	lol
Jul 14 00:08:41 <emusan>	usually more than windows...
Jul 14 00:08:45 <[]J>	hah
Jul 14 00:08:57 <emusan>	I only use windows for gaming...
Jul 14 00:09:08 <[]J>	hey actually, if you do that...
Jul 14 00:09:17 <[]J>	when you run Linux on a VM, are you able to use your 3d card?
Jul 14 00:10:35 <emusan>	I dunno
Jul 14 00:10:40 <emusan>	I haven't needed to
Jul 14 00:10:45 <emusan>	I just do programming and stuff
Jul 14 00:10:49 <emusan>	I use virtualbox...
Jul 14 00:11:15 <[]J>	not game programming I take it
Jul 14 00:11:19 <[]J>	otherwise that'd be very relevant
Jul 14 00:11:34 <[]J>	or anything that takes advantage of the GPU's processing power for that matter...
Jul 14 00:11:56 <emusan>	I do game programming...
Jul 14 00:11:59 <emusan>	but 2D...
Jul 14 00:12:05 <[]J>	that still needs a 3d card man
Jul 14 00:12:09 <emusan>	and very shitty graphics...
Jul 14 00:12:13 <[]J>	oh, hahahah :P
Jul 14 00:12:15 <emusan>	well all graphics do lol
Jul 14 00:12:34 <emusan>	its not like I'm doing evil Linux or something...
Jul 14 00:12:35 <[]J>	eh, with super minimal stuff you can get away without it ;/
Jul 14 00:12:47 <[]J>	but if you want shaders, or lots of stuff on the screen at once . . .
Jul 14 00:12:52 <[]J>	anyhow, using VMware I couldn't install 3d card drivers
Jul 14 00:12:59 <[]J>	so: couldn't test my game for linux users
Jul 14 00:13:09 <[]J>	at least without dual booting, but yuck :1
Jul 14 00:13:23 <emusan>	thats cause you using Java
Jul 14 00:13:25 <[]J>	also wanted to test OSX since my artist (with an OSX) is a tard
Jul 14 00:13:33 <emusan>	lol
Jul 14 00:14:00 <[]J>	what does me using Java have to do with it?
Jul 14 00:14:13 <[]J>	I can't use anything that needs a 3d card in vmware :1
Jul 14 00:14:33 <emusan>	doesn't your window manager need it?
Jul 14 00:14:35 <[]J>	looking on random internet forums it looks either impossible or asininely complex to rig up
Jul 14 00:15:11 <[]J>	uh, well, not sure I understand, but, I need the 3d card rigged up to even open my game
Jul 14 00:21:26 <SicariusVelox>	yeah it's super crazy to get proper hardware acceleration in vmware
Jul 14 00:21:43 <emusan>	use virtualbox!
Jul 14 00:21:51 <emusan>	I found it much easier and nicer interface...
Jul 14 00:21:55 <emusan>	at least in debian
Jul 14 00:21:58 <emusan>	and haiku
Jul 14 00:22:03 <SicariusVelox>	virtualbox is pretty good at doing it though
Jul 14 00:23:19 <[]J>	righto, will check it out :D
Jul 14 00:24:06 <[]J>	thanks for the tip

Jul 14 01:22:55 <emusan>	he releases this...
Jul 14 01:23:33 <Splarka>	carefully timed release of videos to maximize continuation of interest?
Jul 14 01:23:59 <emusan>	I'm guessing so

Jul 14 11:06:25 ---	ChanServ sets mode +q #nD gBev
Jul 14 11:06:25 ---	ChanServ gives channel operator status to gBev
Jul 14 11:08:11 <emusan>	hi gBev
Jul 14 11:08:17 <emusan>	see the new video?
Jul 14 11:24:27 <gBev>	yeah
Jul 14 11:24:40 <gBev>	i'm glad he showed it emusan but it was hardly a firmware demo
Jul 14 11:24:51 <emusan>	yar...
Jul 14 11:24:51 <gBev>	5 seconds of firmware then a ton of bob's game
Jul 14 11:24:54 <emusan>	but its something...
Jul 14 11:25:02 <gBev>	also he really really needs to redesign it
Jul 14 11:25:08 <emusan>	more than we've had in weeks...
Jul 14 11:25:11 <gBev>	the loading screen is kind of bad looking
Jul 14 11:25:13 <emusan>	I kinda like the design..
Jul 14 11:25:15 <gBev>	i suppose so
Jul 14 11:25:16 <emusan>	ya
Jul 14 11:25:29 <emusan>	lol I don't think it will appeal to kids though
Jul 14 11:25:31 <emusan>	just matrix fans
Jul 14 11:25:33 <gBev>	exactly
Jul 14 11:25:51 <gBev>	the background needs to be better looking than just 'nD'
Jul 14 11:25:55 <gBev>	some kind of color gradient
Jul 14 11:26:25 <emusan>	I thought the background was kinda neat
Jul 14 11:26:37 <emusan>	if you look closely they kinda pulsate
Jul 14 11:26:49 <emusan>	its subtle, but nice...
Jul 14 11:28:28 <[]Java>	I liked it vOv
Jul 14 11:28:43 <[]Java>	kind of minimalist, not too in your face, while not being ugly
Jul 14 11:28:52 <[]Java>	not like you need to like the menu screen :o)

Jul 14 11:30:11 <emusan>	I don't want it to appeal to children lol
Jul 14 11:30:16 <emusan>	i /hate/ kids
Jul 14 11:30:19 <emusan>	ol
Jul 14 11:30:21 <emusan>	lol*
Jul 14 11:30:23 <emusan>	jk
Jul 14 11:30:38 <emusan>	lol I wonder if he has any plans for tech support...
Jul 14 11:30:53 <emusan>	cause I'm not answering ever "how do I turn this on" question on the forums...
Jul 14 11:31:27 <fefe>	but, how do you turn this thing on? haven't seen a power button
Jul 14 11:31:48 <emusan>	~~magic~~
Jul 14 11:31:49 <emusan>	of course
Jul 14 11:31:53 <emusan>	its Bob after all
Jul 14 11:32:32 <[]Java>	gBev: cheap, portable, not high investment for vidya
Jul 14 11:32:48 <emusan>	and you're right, I see no powerswitch either...
Jul 14 11:33:01 <gBev>	i suppose
Jul 14 11:33:08 <emusan>	lol fefe post it in the forums
Jul 14 11:33:19 <emusan>	see if he answers...
Jul 14 11:33:23 <gBev>	but for the time being i only think it's going to appeal to the indie gaming crowd
Jul 14 11:33:46 <[]Java>	poor people would probably like it too
Jul 14 11:33:50 <[]Java>	no money for a fukken iphone

Jul 14 11:35:00 <gBev>	the second part of it
Jul 14 11:35:10 <[]Java>	people who type "?" or "what?" and expect it to be answered properly should be shot
Jul 14 11:35:23 <gBev>	thanks for the tip
Jul 14 11:35:40 <[]Java>	makes my brain go wild thinking of every possible thing they could be not understanding
Jul 14 11:35:48 <[]Java>	because they couldn't be assed to be more clear :1
Jul 14 11:35:55 <emusan>	gbev, a lot of people moved to #eon...
Jul 14 11:35:58 <gBev>	really helping me out here, thanks
Jul 14 11:36:14 <gBev>	#eon is empty from here
Jul 14 11:36:23 <emusan>	uhhh...
Jul 14 11:36:28 <[]Java>	it says they moved in the topic
Jul 14 11:36:32 <[]Java>	(to another server)
Jul 14 11:36:36 <gBev>	ah
Jul 14 11:36:38 <gBev>	i wonder why
Jul 14 11:36:40 <emusan>	haven't finished move yet...
Jul 14 11:36:42 <emusan>	and its not empty
Jul 14 11:37:03 <[]Java>	chat about what? or is it just like, people left over from bob's forum 
Jul 14 11:37:07 <emusan>	we're moving cause a lot of dev's for pandora and GPH handhelds are using freenode...
Jul 14 11:37:14 <emusan>	[]Java you don't know?
Jul 14 11:37:15 <[]Java>	oh
Jul 14 11:37:19 <[]Java>	not at all
Jul 14 11:37:20 <emusan>	Triverske's console...
Jul 14 11:37:27 <gBev>	#eon on freenode is also empty
Jul 14 11:37:32 <[]Java>	heh
Jul 14 11:37:37 <emusan>	its #eon-dev on freenode
Jul 14 11:37:44 <emusan>	#eon was some gaming company
Jul 14 11:37:49 <emusan>	been empty since 2007
Jul 14 11:38:02 <gBev>	meh
Jul 14 11:38:05 <gBev>	four people
Jul 14 11:38:09 <Kutagh>	ugh, I dont want freenode
Jul 14 11:38:15 <Kutagh>	just stick to synIRC please >.<
Jul 14 11:38:18 <emusan>	way more people on the synirc one...
Jul 14 11:38:23 <gBev>	we're not moving, no worries
Jul 14 11:38:27 <emusan>	7...
Jul 14 11:38:28 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 14 11:38:32 <emusan>	its for another topic...
Jul 14 11:38:41 <gBev>	i need to use another name on freenode, so no
Jul 14 11:38:46 <emusan>	lol kutagh, only eon is moving...
Jul 14 11:38:51 <[]Java>	oh wait I'm actually connected to freenode already
Jul 14 11:38:51 <Kutagh>	emusan, I know.
Jul 14 11:38:56 *	[]Java has like 30 channels open
Jul 14 11:38:58 <Kutagh>	I'm referring to eon ;)
Jul 14 11:39:05 <emusan>	oh...
Jul 14 11:39:08 <emusan>	why not kutagh?

Jul 14 11:39:43 <gBev>	yeah
Jul 14 11:39:48 <[]Java>	it's easy if you write a script to join all the servers 
Jul 14 11:39:56 <gBev>	hence why i made this in the same one as #bgf
Jul 14 11:39:58 <emusan>	lol
Jul 14 11:40:01 <[]Java>	and you use a client like mirc which can neatly display lots of channels/servers <#:)
Jul 14 11:40:08 <gBev>	java yeah but it just looks cleaner this way
Jul 14 11:40:12 <Kutagh>	[]Java, thats not the issue
Jul 14 11:40:23 <Kutagh>	I got XChat which can easily join multiple servers at startup
Jul 14 11:40:24 <gBev>	i'm connecred to about a dozen channels but only four networks
Jul 14 11:40:30 <gBev>	*connected
Jul 14 11:40:47 <emusan>	I'm on four channels, two networks
Jul 14 11:40:49 <Kutagh>	its still pointless to be connected to 3 servers for 5 channels

Jul 14 11:48:29 <emusan>	he'll probably run into manufacturing problems

Jul 15 22:21:27 <pandabear41>	hello
Jul 15 22:21:41 <emusan>	have you been on the irc much?
Jul 15 22:21:49 <emusan>	I don't really remember you being on...
Jul 15 22:21:53 <emusan>	but I forget things :(
Jul 15 22:22:01 <pandabear41>	Nope. I was on a few last week as a different name.
Jul 15 22:22:28 <pandabear41>	But it was only for 3 hours on Sat and Sun.
Jul 15 22:23:23 <emusan>	ah
Jul 15 22:23:59 <pandabear41>	I am kinda bored. I don't want to code, all done with my anime, and got my dota fix. :P
Jul 15 22:24:36 <emusan>	lol...
Jul 15 22:24:44 <emusan>	I don't wanna code much either right now...
Jul 15 22:24:51 <emusan>	even though my best code can be at night...
Jul 15 22:24:59 <emusan>	but I usually forget what I was doing the next morning
Jul 15 22:25:03 <emusan>	lol
Jul 15 22:25:39 <Exophase>	pandabear41; You're the emu porting dude.
Jul 15 22:25:45 <pandabear41>	That always happens to me. That is why I put stickies on my monitor, that tell me what I was doing. 
Jul 15 22:25:50 <Exophase>	Maybe I'll invoke you later ;p

Jul 15 22:26:27 <emusan>	oooh exophase has a new friend :)
Jul 15 22:26:39 <Exophase>	Everyone wants to be my friend.
Jul 15 22:26:44 <pandabear41>	Not just emu, I am working on fixing up my old game library, then I am going to get it working with lua, basic, and a wxWidgets ui. :D
Jul 15 22:26:45 <Exophase>	I have a compelling personality.
Jul 15 22:26:55 <Exophase>	pandabear41; Just the same.
Jul 15 22:27:03 <Exophase>	Maybe I'll invoke your emu porting.
Jul 15 22:27:40 <Exophase>	So that's pretty messed, what that jackass on the Android market did to you.
Jul 15 22:27:42 <Exophase>	.. messed up
Jul 15 22:27:48 <pandabear41>	I will not do anything other than NES and atari. I might do gameboy, but meh.
Jul 15 22:28:10 <Exophase>	You don't inspire enough confidence when you say you won't do something then maybe will immediately afterwards.
Jul 15 22:28:11 <pandabear41>	It has happened to me 3 times. The android marketplace being the worst.
Jul 15 22:28:39 <Exophase>	Anyway I don't need you for gameboy so I guess that's that!
Jul 15 22:28:41 <emusan>	dang...
Jul 15 22:28:52 <emusan>	have you used slidme pandabear41?
Jul 15 22:28:52 <pandabear41>	What did you need?
Jul 15 22:30:55 <emusan>	me?
Jul 15 22:30:58 <emusan>	or exophase?
Jul 15 22:31:03 <emusan>	lol prolly exophase...
Jul 15 22:31:10 <pandabear41>	Nope. I have seen it before tho.
Jul 15 22:31:12 <pandabear41>	Yah exophase...
Jul 15 22:32:03 <emusan>	slideme is kinda nice cause they don't seem to take a cut...
Jul 15 22:32:15 <emusan>	but of course, very small audience...
Jul 15 22:33:07 <emusan>	lol did the hate mail have a return address?
Jul 15 22:34:32 <pandabear41>	Everything was anonymous. No return address, sent from a home connection. Mail had no return, and phone was blocked caller. Its behind me tho.
Jul 15 22:35:00 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 15 22:35:19 <pandabear41>	I knew the city of origin from the mail, and that is it.

Jul 15 22:37:49 <pandabear41>	But I did not make it that big of a deal. The other time it has happened to me, just ignore it, its not the end of the world. Pressing charges is too much effort and time I don't have. If they really want to come to my house I have 2 handguns, 2 shotguns, and 1 rifle. :P
Jul 15 22:38:19 <emusan>	lol nice
Jul 15 22:38:23 <emusan>	what state are you in?
Jul 15 22:38:54 <pandabear41>	CA. In the boonies.
Jul 15 22:39:03 <emusan>	ah...
Jul 15 22:39:34 <emusan>	in MA its not easy to get a gun license :(
Jul 15 22:40:07 <emusan>	not that I could really use one yet, most colleges don't want you to bring guns, and I wouldn't leave it at home...
Jul 15 22:41:39 <emusan>	so... how good are you with android stuff?
Jul 15 22:41:50 <emusan>	like installing market on a device without it...
Jul 15 22:42:07 <emusan>	if you don't mind me picking your brain a bit :D
Jul 15 22:45:39 <pandabear41>	Back. GF came back with some frozen yogurt. Um you would have to root it. Get the market file onto the device and install it. 
Jul 15 22:46:54 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 15 22:47:06 <emusan>	I'm a little further than that, but running into some problems...
Jul 15 22:47:21 <pandabear41>	Where at?
Jul 15 22:47:39 <emusan>	turns out that the market has a lot of things in place to keep people like me out lol...
Jul 15 22:48:12 <emusan>	well, I used Titanium Backup to back up market, google services framework, gmail, and ~6 other apps from a device with working market...
Jul 15 22:48:43 <emusan>	unfortunately, unless you use the email used on the other device it wont work...
Jul 15 22:48:56 <emusan>	I want to make something that people can use without another rooted device...
Jul 15 22:49:15 <emusan>	it comes up with an error like this: E/vending ( 9546): [29] AsynchRequestRunner$1.runRequestRetryingFailure(): Got ApiException from async request: Error from backend. Request=com.android.vending.model.GetAssetRequest, Response=INTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR
Jul 15 22:49:18 <emusan>	from the logcat...
Jul 15 22:49:52 <emusan>	and just says "download was unsuccessful, please try again"
Jul 15 22:50:54 <emusan>	I can give the list of all the apps if that would help...

Jul 15 22:52:12 <emusan>	some...
Jul 15 22:52:19 <emusan>	Talk says authentication failed...
Jul 15 22:52:33 <emusan>	that was anther installed one...
Jul 15 22:52:34 <pandabear41>	Is this on a phone or a tablet?
Jul 15 22:52:37 <emusan>	Gmail works...
Jul 15 22:52:38 <emusan>	tablet...
Jul 15 22:59:38 <pandabear41>	Back again, Try clearing the download manager's cache.
Jul 15 23:00:42 <emusan>	ah...
Jul 15 23:00:54 <emusan>	I did that once before, but I've done some more things this time as well..
Jul 15 23:01:09 <emusan>	hows the frozen yogurt?
Jul 15 23:01:18 <pandabear41>	Bah, just got a DMV vehicle registration notice. $596. :(
Jul 15 23:01:20 <pandabear41>	Good
Jul 15 23:01:31 <emusan>	:(
Jul 15 23:01:39 <emusan>	DMV/RMV are annoying...
Jul 15 23:02:29 <pandabear41>	Especially in CA, its a real big pain.
Jul 15 23:03:31 <emusan>	hrm... clear cache is not an option for the download manager...
Jul 15 23:03:35 <emusan>	would clear data do it?
Jul 15 23:03:46 <emusan>	+ a force stop?
Jul 15 23:03:53 <pandabear41>	That is the option!
Jul 15 23:04:03 <pandabear41>	Clear data!
Jul 15 23:04:24 <emusan>	should I force stop as well?
Jul 15 23:04:29 <pandabear41>	Yah
Jul 15 23:05:19 <emusan>	hrm...
Jul 15 23:05:22 <emusan>	didn't seem to work...
Jul 15 23:05:29 <emusan>	gonna restart and try again though...
Jul 15 23:05:40 <emusan>	sometimes other things I do can affect it...
Jul 15 23:05:49 <pandabear41>	Meh, that is what worked for me on my phone.
Jul 15 23:06:01 <emusan>	you have a phone without market access?
Jul 15 23:06:03 <emusan>	which one?
Jul 15 23:07:26 <pandabear41>	Its one of Xperias.
Jul 15 23:07:37 <emusan>	oh
Jul 15 23:07:49 <emusan>	I would think sony would get official support...
Jul 15 23:09:52 <pandabear41>	Yah they do, but an upgrade broke it right after I got it. :P
Jul 15 23:10:54 <emusan>	ah...
Jul 15 23:10:58 <emusan>	well it didn't work :(
Jul 15 23:11:02 <emusan>	I tried a few things...
Jul 15 23:11:31 <pandabear41>	Meh
Jul 15 23:16:37 <pandabear41>	The only other thing I can think of is to reset it.
Jul 15 23:17:00 <emusan>	you mean like a factory reset right?
Jul 15 23:17:17 <emusan>	problem with that is that it didn't have market installed originally...
Jul 15 23:17:19 <pandabear41>	Yah, that is what my friend in IM tells me.
Jul 15 23:17:47 <pandabear41>	oh
Jul 15 23:17:49 <emusan>	I guess I could try it though...
Jul 15 23:18:12 <emusan>	is your friend also good with this kinda stuff?
Jul 15 23:18:48 <pandabear41>	IDK, he had the same problem and a factory reset worked.
Jul 15 23:19:00 <emusan>	I'll try it...
Jul 15 23:19:12 <emusan>	I don't think the device had a factory reset option before installing htem...
Jul 15 23:19:15 <emusan>	never know :)
Jul 15 23:26:17 <pandabear41>	Exophase, did you say you are working on a game library?
Jul 15 23:52:07 <emusan>	lol factory data reset didn't work :(

Jul 16 11:19:43 <Exophase>	Oh cool, a thread!
Jul 16 11:19:45 *	Exophase reads
Jul 16 11:20:55 <Exophase>	Oh, off topic :(
Jul 16 11:21:10 <Exophase>	.. what is this ;p
Jul 16 11:21:26 <Exophase>	Also. I'm actually a little surprised Bob is okaying emulators.
Jul 16 11:21:48 <Exophase>	There is no question in my mind that free emulators will decrease the attachment rate of this platform, which is 100% of its survival.
Jul 16 11:22:00 <Exophase>	Will decrease the attachment rate a LOT
Jul 16 11:23:35 <[]J>	well I did say it was stupid
Jul 16 11:24:00 <[]J>	Exophase because it will take away from the identity of it, right?
Jul 16 11:24:37 <[]J>	eh
Jul 16 11:24:40 <[]J>	dunno how I feel
Jul 16 11:24:49 <[]J>	I still think that nD exclusives alone could carry it
Jul 16 11:24:50 <Exophase>	No, much more direct than that.
Jul 16 11:24:55 <Exophase>	Because people will buy nDs just to play emulators.
Jul 16 11:25:00 <Exophase>	Or to play emulators more than they play other things.
Jul 16 11:25:32 <[]J>	bob's game certainly won't carry it to glory, even if it's the best thing since ever
Jul 16 11:25:47 <Exophase>	You have to carefully balance sales with attachment rate. It might be worth lower attachment rate if the sales bulk goes up. It might be worth attracting people with a free feature if getting the device in their hands means they'll buy new things.
Jul 16 11:25:54 <[]J>	its name alone immediately will make it bargain bin material in most people's minds
Jul 16 11:25:54 <Exophase>	But lots and lots of people will put emulators on it and nothing else.
Jul 16 11:26:20 <Exophase>	I don't think anything will carry it to glory, and having emulators doesn't make it groundbreaking or impressive, just a little cheaper than the millions of Chinese platforms that do.
Jul 16 11:26:28 <[]J>	kind of reminds me of the android thing though
Jul 16 11:26:35 <[]J>	people got attached to free apps on the android
Jul 16 11:26:43 <[]J>	and feel gross actually buying stuff
Jul 16 11:26:49 <[]J>	because there's the "free culture"
Jul 16 11:26:55 <Exophase>	At least on Android there was a precedent for pay apps on iOS
Jul 16 11:27:04 <Exophase>	Even if a lot of people are counter to that, many parties will sell the same stuff..
Jul 16 11:27:22 <Exophase>	The thing is, there'll be too little push to develop high quality new things on nD that people will want to pay for..
Jul 16 11:27:35 <Exophase>	And a lot of the apps that sell on marketplaces are utilities that don't work on something like nD
Jul 16 11:27:39 <[]J>	ya
Jul 16 11:27:53 <[]J>	wasn't really thinking that "nD exclusives" could really be a thing
Jul 16 11:28:05 <[]J>	unless you've got some masochist devs with time and money to blow
Jul 16 11:28:28 <[]J>	maybe people could be persuaded to release on nD FIRST or something
Jul 16 11:38:42 <Exophase>	I just don't know how he'll get investors with no proposed profit on the units. They have to put up a bunch of money for R&D and marketing that's pure loss until stuff on the app store sells.
Jul 16 11:39:08 <Exophase>	No one in their right mind would try that without some sort of market research that shows it will, or if you some really good stuff on there..
Jul 16 11:39:36 <Exophase>	A totally new company selling their first product in the quantity of millions would have to be some kind of disruptive technology..

Jul 16 15:45:54 <beoran3>	emulation on ND? what ever will you be able to emulate on such an underpowered machine? Gameboy classic/color, Atari2600 and NES perhaps. Nothing that matters anymore.
Jul 16 15:47:49 <Exophase>	How do you figure that? The prototype is way more powerful than a GP2X, so wouldn't you be able to emulate whatever that emulates?
Jul 16 15:47:58 <Exophase>	Including Genesis, PC-Engine, SNES and GBA to some extent
Jul 16 15:48:07 <Exophase>	(more if faster SNES and GBA emulators were done ;p)
Jul 16 15:48:34 <Languid>	What about the Sega Master? Will no one think of the Sega Master? :D
Jul 16 15:48:44 <Exophase>	Yes of course SMS/Gamegear are a given.
Jul 16 15:49:07 <Languid>	This 8bit Sega-kid thanks you Exophase ^_^
Jul 16 15:49:32 <Exophase>	Of course you need someone to port them. pandabear says he's doing NES and Atari 2600, that's it.
Jul 16 15:50:29 <Languid>	Ya I know, pretty sure there already is an emulator for sms/gg using the sdl but I've forgotten it's name :S
Jul 16 15:50:53 <Exophase>	Ugh, if emulators have to use SDL I hope it has direct framebuffer access.
Jul 16 15:52:27 ---	JosJuice1 is now known as JosJuice
Jul 16 15:52:56 <Exophase>	And it'd better have the framebuffer in main memory, although I'm sure it will.

Jul 16 15:55:19 <Exophase>	I've seen more than one handheld deliver poor emulation performance because it took forever to modify the framebuffer.
Jul 16 15:55:38 <Languid>	My Mistake: I thought Osmose requires sdl but I think it's just using it to setup window for openGL
Jul 16 15:56:36 <Exophase>	I'm sure there are plenty of SMS/GG emulators that aren't too difficult ports
Jul 16 15:56:40 <Exophase>	afaik even Picodrive supports it
Jul 16 15:56:46 <Exophase>	As many Genesis emulators do.
Jul 16 15:57:49 <Languid>	The 2 I usually use were Meka and Osmose and I think they both use SDL but not sure if that's just to setup window or what *not much of a programmer :S*
Jul 16 15:58:23 <Exophase>	Meka is ooooold
Jul 16 15:58:25 <Exophase>	But whatever works
Jul 16 16:00:17 <Languid>	So? The SMS is old too :P I'm not sure how many new features there are to add, plus it has fun stuff like skins, colour palette, and sprite windows
Jul 16 16:01:52 <Exophase>	Like I said, whatever works..
Jul 16 16:02:53 <Languid>	yeah :P

Jul 17 18:13:54 <emusan>	zomg 20 users
Jul 17 18:13:58 <emusan>	new high I think...
Jul 17 18:17:49 <itidus20>	I am awed by the nD.
Jul 17 18:18:02 <emusan>	whered you hear about it from?
Jul 17 18:18:10 <itidus20>	hmm...
Jul 17 18:18:36 <emusan>	lol I'm guessing the 8-ish other new users heard from the same place...
Jul 17 18:18:51 <itidus20>	I was bored. And so I decided to join the bob's game channel. And in the process of looking up the IRC channel I encountered it.
Jul 17 18:19:13 <itidus20>	So, in other words. Bob's official websites.
Jul 17 18:19:15 <emusan>	oh lol
Jul 17 18:19:25 <emusan>	so probably not why we have so many people then...
Jul 17 18:19:28 <itidus20>	the youtube channel and bobsgame.com
Jul 17 18:19:46 <itidus20>	and then found my way to the-nd.com
Jul 17 18:21:00 <Languid>	I heard from hackaday
Jul 17 18:21:29 <emusan>	ah...
Jul 17 18:21:39 <emusan>	that was a few days ago though...
Jul 17 18:22:24 <itidus20>	I'm a bit of a fan. I've seen the Bob at GDC videos
Jul 17 18:26:39 <--	emusan has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 17 18:27:30 <itidus20>	Hmm. There was an interesting site I encounterd yesterday which is about boardgames.
Jul 17 18:27:55 <itidus20>	The main difference between this site and nD is that you can't pirate a boardgame.
Jul 17 18:28:23 <itidus20>	by the way im absolutely not spamming this.
Jul 17 18:28:25 <Kutagh>	you cant pirate a nD either. You can likely pirate the games for the nD though :p
Jul 17 18:28:38 <itidus20>	the second difference is they expect a 50% cut instead of a 10% cut
Jul 17 18:28:59 <itidus20>	http://thegamecrafter.com/publish/selling-your-game
Jul 17 18:30:38 <itidus20>	hmm
Jul 17 18:31:30 <itidus20>	So from what I was reading, the main reasons that piracy needs to be avoided is that a)developers need pay b)investors need pay
Jul 17 18:33:04 <Kutagh>	Piracy is not necessarily bad
Jul 17 18:33:11 <Kutagh>	For indie developers, it gives them additional exposure
Jul 17 18:33:19 <itidus20>	Unfortunately human nature is exploitative. Some % of humans given the chance tend to strike at the vulnerabilities of a system for their advantage.
Jul 17 18:33:28 <Kutagh>	yeah
Jul 17 18:33:48 <Kutagh>	besides, pirated copies don't equate one-to-one to sales
Jul 17 18:34:15 <itidus20>	Oh, I'm not some hardline copyright extremist.
Jul 17 18:34:25 <Kutagh>	If I download 50 games and buy one of them, I likely would've purchased maybe one more game, likely only one or zero if I couldn't pirate.
Jul 17 18:34:49 <itidus20>	I just don't want nD to die because of it.
Jul 17 18:35:06 <Kutagh>	I don't mind copyrights. The thing is, companies should start shifting the blame to themselves, not to the piracing.
Jul 17 18:35:26 <Kutagh>	In the end, couple reasons why I'd pirate?
Jul 17 18:35:41 <Kutagh>	It is easier, 70% of the games are available earlier by pirating than retail
Jul 17 18:35:47 <itidus20>	lol
Jul 17 18:35:59 <Kutagh>	(due to the America/European geographical division in release dates)
Jul 17 18:36:00 <itidus20>	it's also platform independant
Jul 17 18:36:17 <Kutagh>	and due to the quality of some developers nowadays
Jul 17 18:36:24 *	Kutagh is looking at Activision and EA
Jul 17 18:36:41 <itidus20>	Easier to get an emulator running on your existing platform than to go on ebay and fight over some ancient platform.
Jul 17 18:36:50 <itidus20>	It just is.
Jul 17 18:37:00 <Kutagh>	I mean, I haven't forgotten "The Saboteur" from EA. I'm glad I didn't buy it because it had a serious bug, due to which you just couldnt play the game with an ATI card.
Jul 17 18:37:29 <Kutagh>	If that kind of thing is happening more often and often, are you still going to fork out money for a sub-par (or non-existent) experience?
Jul 17 18:37:51 <Kutagh>	my point: Companies need to evolve their business. Games are not a product, they're a service!
Jul 17 18:38:12 <itidus20>	I have another view which is probably controversial.
Jul 17 18:38:18 <Kutagh>	hmmm?
Jul 17 18:38:26 <itidus20>	Due to mass piracy, or sharing, whatever you will call it
Jul 17 18:38:37 <Kutagh>	I call it piracy
Jul 17 18:38:45 <itidus20>	A lot of people end up with more than they could ever hope to afford within their city.
Jul 17 18:39:02 <Kutagh>	True.
Jul 17 18:39:14 <Kutagh>	Though I partially blame the companies for that as well
Jul 17 18:39:30 <Kutagh>	Some company should've spotted the gap in the market, the service
Jul 17 18:39:30 <itidus20>	Like if the total spending of a given city is X. Then due to piracy, the occupants of that city could all have works > X^2.
Jul 17 18:39:54 <Kutagh>	and actually try to combat piracy by ease of use/accessibility
Jul 17 18:40:05 <Kutagh>	I mean, netflix is quite popular in the US, aint it?
Jul 17 18:40:08 <itidus20>	Now, this is also likely true of the whole world. That it puts more works in peoples hands than the entire global economy could afford to do.
Jul 17 18:40:23 <Kutagh>	actually itidus20 
Jul 17 18:40:27 <Kutagh>	ur describing America :p
Jul 17 18:40:41 <Kutagh>	the country of living beyond your means
Jul 17 18:41:13 <Languid>	yeah, very true Kutagh 
Jul 17 18:41:24 <itidus20>	I mean, supposing an individual could never afford to obtain all the music and movies and books and games ever made... then is it ethically bad that they should?
Jul 17 18:42:17 <itidus20>	The opportunity for them to do so will never arise under any circumstances, legally
Jul 17 18:42:41 <Kutagh>	itidus20, seems Netflix is quite popular and like 10 bucks a month for unlimited access to all movies
Jul 17 18:42:56 <Kutagh>	THAT is what I'm talking about, what I'd like to see the gaming business like
Jul 17 18:43:20 <Kutagh>	hell, have different packages with different content
Jul 17 18:43:38 <itidus20>	So... this is a tricky idea.
Jul 17 18:43:38 <Kutagh>	someone that does game a lot can likely afford $25-$30 a month
Jul 17 18:44:04 <itidus20>	like, if an nD user could pay an optional monthly fee to play whatever games they liked
Jul 17 18:44:30 <itidus20>	or buy them individually
Jul 17 18:44:37 <Kutagh>	issue is obviously how you slice the cake towards the publishers (or here the devs)
Jul 17 18:44:48 <itidus20>	yup.
Jul 17 18:44:50 <Kutagh>	myself I'd propose based on gametime played
Jul 17 18:45:01 <Kutagh>	convinces developers to keep their games updated with new content
Jul 17 18:45:06 <Kutagh>	and ensure longetivity
Jul 17 18:46:06 <itidus20>	they could literally slice the cake
Jul 17 18:47:13 <itidus20>	just an idea
Jul 17 18:47:16 <Kutagh>	OnLive seems to be going in the right direction regarding that for the gaming market but unfortunately it seems SOMETHING is blocking it on my network (even though I forwarded the correct ports and tried a lot of shit =.=)
Jul 17 18:47:34 <Kutagh>	slice the cake equally for every game available?
Jul 17 18:47:57 <Languid>	Gametap, blockbuster, and there's another mail/disc based one I forget doing this
Jul 17 18:47:59 <Kutagh>	then it might be smarter to factor in the downloads 
Jul 17 18:48:32 <itidus20>	well, total income of monthly fees * 90%(or some other figure for this system) * amount that game is player
Jul 17 18:49:15 <itidus20>	well.. there could be a certain thing for being played at all.. like merely being downloaded or run.. and a declining addition for game length
Jul 17 18:50:42 <itidus20>	but having said this, individual game sales is of course the important model.
Jul 17 18:50:51 <itidus20>	but they are both curious
Jul 17 18:51:24 <itidus20>	Also... a system to enable someone else to donate games to the community would be cool
Jul 17 18:51:43 <Kutagh>	like Steam's gifting system
Jul 17 18:51:58 *	Kutagh abused that before... American gifts me game which is cheaper in $$ than in €€
Jul 17 18:52:58 <itidus20>	there could also be a donate system where you win a game by a luckydrawn :P
Jul 17 18:53:02 <itidus20>	^draw
Jul 17 18:53:34 <itidus20>	and if you don't want it you could put it back in the pool
Jul 17 18:56:18 <Kutagh>	I'd rather do it with opt-in and not opt-out ;)
Jul 17 18:59:30 <itidus20>	oh cool
Jul 17 19:01:02 <itidus20>	If there was someone who wanted to donate it could be a fun option.

Jul 17 20:20:40 <Languid>	Irock, http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php SDL Tutorials :D It's a neat library 
Jul 17 20:21:09 <Irock>	ahh, thanks
Jul 17 20:21:32 <Irock>	I'll bookmark this
Jul 17 20:21:49 <Irock>	I plan to start learning after I finish the current game I'm working on
Jul 17 20:21:58 <Languid>	Which OS?
Jul 17 20:22:10 <Irock>	the game?
Jul 17 20:22:22 <Irock>	or which OS do I use?
Jul 17 20:22:31 <Languid>	yeah, Windows I take it?
Jul 17 20:22:41 <Irock>	I use Windows
Jul 17 20:23:09 <Irock>	I have an Ubuntu install though
Jul 17 20:24:22 <Languid>	Well If you code in c or c++ with the SDL your games can run on both which is a nice Upshot

Jul 17 20:26:06 <Irock>	yeah
Jul 17 20:26:29 <Irock>	I've used a program called Stencyl to make Flash games thus far
Jul 17 20:26:51 <Irock>	I've learned a lot about game development and logic
Jul 17 20:27:03 <Irock>	just need the coding part
Jul 17 20:27:30 <Irock>	oh, and graphics and music
Jul 17 20:27:53 <Irock>	I couldn't do anything a couple years ago @_@
Jul 17 20:27:58 <Languid>	xD
Jul 17 20:28:18 <Languid>	always learning new things, your can always do more then you could

Jul 17 21:18:27 <itidus20>	the forum said they tried kickstarer
Jul 17 21:18:49 <itidus20>	there are some games on kickstarter
Jul 17 21:19:06 <itidus20>	on the forum, someone mentioned that the total monthly donations of kickstarter is 7m
Jul 17 21:19:13 <itidus20>	and so its just not enough
Jul 17 21:20:25 <emusan>	I think kickstarter rejected bob
Jul 17 21:20:27 <Exophase>	He said he looked at kickstarter but found there was no way he'd get enough money from it, which is probably true.
Jul 17 21:20:36 <emusan>	probably because he's insane...
Jul 17 21:20:51 <emusan>	lol if Kickstarter can't fund it likely nothing will...
Jul 17 21:21:00 <Exophase>	Hm, I haven't looked at kickstarter's terms.. I guess most things I've seen there have been funding to produce completed or mostly completed projects but I haven't looked around.
Jul 17 21:21:25 <Exophase>	emusan; He needs lots of money from a few individuals, he can't get little money from several individuals..
Jul 17 21:21:26 <Languid>	I think kinckstart is turning away alot of buisness projects now and focusing on  the arts like comics and movies
Jul 17 21:22:21 <emusan>	exophase, I like your latest post in the firmware thread...
Jul 17 21:22:28 <emusan>	I forgot he was depending on game sales to make money
Jul 17 21:22:33 <Exophase>	emusan; s'all something to think about
Jul 17 21:22:36 <emusan>	lol and then he goes about alienating dev's...
Jul 17 21:22:43 <emusan>	its soo backwards...
Jul 17 21:22:50 <Exophase>	Everyone wants to see prototypes and demos and hype so badly..
Jul 17 21:23:05 <Exophase>	At least Bob is write about that much, that's all missing the point.
Jul 17 21:23:20 <emusan>	a lot of dev's just want to make sure its real...
Jul 17 21:23:20 <Exophase>	But getting these handhelds in millions of hands is kind of missing the point too, if the software doesn't follow.
Jul 17 21:23:35 <Exophase>	A large percentage of the people begging for info aren't devs.
Jul 17 21:23:42 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 21:23:57 <emusan>	but a large percentage of the people on the site at all aren't dev's
Jul 17 21:23:58 <Exophase>	Anyway look at the top project lists for Kickstarter..
Jul 17 21:24:02 <Exophase>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter
Jul 17 21:24:12 <Exophase>	Nothing generating millions, most of the more successful stuff is under $100k
Jul 17 21:24:22 <emusan>	yeah.. I support a lot of kickstarter stuff...
Jul 17 21:24:32 <Exophase>	Both of the tech related things are Apple accessories.
Jul 17 21:24:36 <Exophase>	(that are over $100k)
Jul 17 21:24:44 <emusan>	It prolly wouldn't give him enough money...
Jul 17 21:24:48 <emusan>	but it would help...
Jul 17 21:25:13 <Exophase>	I wonder..
Jul 17 21:25:50 <Exophase>	The unfortunate thing with Kickstarter, which would be more beneficial in his case, is that it's easier to get an individual to part with a small amount of money without understanding any of the technicality behind it.
Jul 17 21:26:02 <Exophase>	And then try to get many individuals. Instead of getting a few big investors.
Jul 17 21:26:38 <Exophase>	Because unless those investors are morons they will want to see full manufacturing plans and quotes that demonstrate how he is able to sell this for $10 or whatever.
Jul 17 21:26:47 <Exophase>	While all those micro-investors will just see "$10 handheld! Cool idea!"
Jul 17 21:26:59 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 21:27:13 <emusan>	and then he could set a price point on there for like $20 and get a handheld...
Jul 17 21:27:22 <emusan>	$30 get handheld + Bob's game...
Jul 17 21:27:24 <emusan>	etc.
Jul 17 21:27:46 <Exophase>	And then exact same problem once he can't deliver for $20. It'll be a nightmare.
Jul 17 21:27:46 <emusan>	I'm sure he could get a lot of money on there...
Jul 17 21:27:49 <emusan>	its an appealing idea...
Jul 17 21:27:59 <Exophase>	So how does the funding works, if it falls through Kickstarter refunds everyone?
Jul 17 21:28:03 <emusan>	lol I doubt he'll be able to get under $30
Jul 17 21:28:03 <Exophase>	And takes that risk upon themselves?
Jul 17 21:28:36 <emusan>	no, with kickstarter there is a minimum amount to be considered "funded"
Jul 17 21:28:45 <emusan>	if it doesn't hit that, no one pays in the first place
Jul 17 21:29:06 <emusan>	so far I don't think they've had anyone fail after that...
Jul 17 21:29:13 <Exophase>	I see.
Jul 17 21:29:23 <emusan>	They have an application process I think
Jul 17 21:29:27 <Exophase>	Then their review process would have to be pretty thorough.
Jul 17 21:29:31 <emusan>	if they see that your goal is way to high they wont let it though...
Jul 17 21:29:33 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 21:29:48 <emusan>	I thought Bob said he already tried
Jul 17 21:29:51 <emusan>	and they rejected it
Jul 17 21:29:51 <Exophase>	Meaning they're probably more interested in people who are covering straightforward expenses, not funding R&D
Jul 17 21:29:56 <emusan>	prolly cause he wanted millions lol
Jul 17 21:30:08 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 21:30:12 <emusan>	you should already have a plan
Jul 17 21:30:18 <emusan>	and manufactuing laid out
Jul 17 21:30:27 <emusan>	deals with suppliers
Jul 17 21:30:29 <emusan>	etc.
Jul 17 21:30:34 <emusan>	everything he seems to lack lol
Jul 17 21:31:32 <emusan>	I think kickstarter is a great thing though...
Jul 17 21:32:51 <--	Kutagh has quit (Quit: TTYL)
Jul 17 21:33:52 <emusan>	lol exophase, I think Bob wants to ban you
Jul 17 21:34:00 <Exophase>	Why do you say that? ;p
Jul 17 21:34:09 <emusan>	you keep making have to make up stuff...
Jul 17 21:34:21 <emusan>	and contradicting his stories with reason and logic...
Jul 17 21:34:22 <emusan>	lol
Jul 17 21:34:32 <Exophase>	"third party software is most definitely not our only source of profit."
Jul 17 21:34:32 <Exophase>	wut
Jul 17 21:34:33 <Exophase>	Since when.
Jul 17 21:34:50 <Exophase>	Crap, 10% is just for the game store upkeep?!
Jul 17 21:34:55 <Exophase>	What a different story.
Jul 17 21:34:58 <emusan>	lol yeah...
Jul 17 21:35:00 <Exophase>	Then WHERE is his profit coming from?
Jul 17 21:35:07 <emusan>	that made me rofl
Jul 17 21:35:27 <emusan>	he stated multiple times that the appstore is his profit..
Jul 17 21:36:14 <Exophase>	So he's going to make money from first party sales. Right.
Jul 17 21:36:42 <Exophase>	So instead of having to sell several million of several dozen or more apps he'll have to sell several million of.. well, a substantially smaller number.
Jul 17 21:36:44 <emusan>	obviously, /everyone/ wants to play Bob's game...
Jul 17 21:36:50 <itidus20>	lol
Jul 17 21:37:05 <emusan>	clearly the game is made for kids and grandparents alike
Jul 17 21:37:09 <Exophase>	Here's the glaring question: why would anyone agree to work for nD games if they get less than the 90% they get by submitting separately?
Jul 17 21:37:20 <Exophase>	Outside of Bob himself obviously.
Jul 17 21:37:27 <emusan>	thats what I was wondering...
Jul 17 21:37:34 <emusan>	I wanted to ask him if I could allow pre-orders
Jul 17 21:37:39 <emusan>	outside of the store...
Jul 17 21:37:47 <emusan>	then let users sideload the app's...
Jul 17 21:37:56 <emusan>	then I get 100% of the profit as well lol
Jul 17 21:39:03 <itidus20>	the thing about japan is that they almost always stress the company over the individual, or the leader over the team
Jul 17 21:39:38 <itidus20>	in comicbooks for example in the west it says: writer: blah, ink: blah: coloring: blah, lettering: blah, editor: blaj
Jul 17 21:40:00 <itidus20>	but, in japan they just give you 1 name usually
Jul 17 21:40:18 <itidus20>	or 2 names if the writer differs from the artist
Jul 17 21:41:14 <emusan>	?
Jul 17 21:41:18 <emusan>	Bob's in the US...
Jul 17 21:41:18 <itidus20>	humm
Jul 17 21:41:21 <itidus20>	i know.
Jul 17 21:41:32 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 17 21:41:33 <emusan>	lol
Jul 17 21:41:37 <itidus20>	nods
Jul 17 21:42:05 <emusan>	not sure what you're getting at...
Jul 17 21:42:57 <itidus20>	well.. i think Bob is eager to emphasise the "games by one person" world
Jul 17 21:43:17 <emusan>	ah...
Jul 17 21:43:29 <itidus20>	and.. when he is comparing himself to shigeru etc, the fact is that shigeru probably never wrote a line of code ever
Jul 17 21:43:48 <itidus20>	as far as i know
Jul 17 21:44:04 <itidus20>	and some people might not even know this
Jul 17 21:44:05 <Exophase>	Posted..
Jul 17 21:44:19 <itidus20>	infact, nintendo didn't even code donkey kong internally
Jul 17 21:44:50 <Exophase>	He compares himself to Miyamato? ;p
Jul 17 21:45:04 <Exophase>	I'm going to laugh if Bob says he DID intend on doing several games himself.
Jul 17 21:45:16 <Exophase>	He can barely even manage one game. Maybe. Over several years.
Jul 17 21:45:43 <itidus20>	ahh.. but literally speakingt.. miyamoto couldn't make shit on his own
Jul 17 21:45:49 <itidus20>	without a team to fall back on
Jul 17 21:45:56 <emusan>	miyamoto is a designer though
Jul 17 21:45:57 <Languid>	itidus20, Nintendo doesn't know quality games like Microsfot sure does http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DONKEY.BAS
Jul 17 21:46:00 <emusan>	there's a difference...
Jul 17 21:46:50 <itidus20>	lol donkey.bas ... i already know bill gates did that without clicking :D
Jul 17 21:47:01 <itidus20>	if its what i think it is
Jul 17 21:47:06 <Exophase>	itidus20; You might be surprised.
Jul 17 21:47:13 <emusan>	lol I bet bob orders a ton of SoC's and then gets informed there's a silicon bug...
Jul 17 21:47:20 <itidus20>	ah co-written
Jul 17 21:47:25 <emusan>	do they have measures to do something if that happens?
Jul 17 21:47:26 <Exophase>	I don't know if he can or not, but I've known a lot of people who were not programmers but ended up programming anyway when push came to shove.
Jul 17 21:47:39 <Exophase>	You work with people long enough and you absorb this.
Jul 17 21:47:46 <Exophase>	Reminds me of Tomato and Mother 3..
Jul 17 21:47:53 <itidus20>	Satoru Iwata however, current nintendo ceo did code
Jul 17 21:48:31 <itidus20>	His companies first title for NES was Pinball, which was the first NES game I got.
Jul 17 21:48:45 <itidus20>	oh uh
Jul 17 21:48:59 <itidus20>	nintendo started Pinball.. but they ran into difficulties so they got HAL to finish it
Jul 17 21:49:59 <Exophase>	I remember Pinball.
Jul 17 21:50:15 <Exophase>	Decent game, but the black background and lack of music depressed me.
Jul 17 21:50:33 <itidus20>	I think he called out adrian carmack INSTEAD of john carmack for a good reason :P
Jul 17 21:50:40 <itidus20>	he was not comparing himself to john
Jul 17 21:51:50 <itidus20>	So.. he is saying that the people he listed couldn't make a game on their own.
Jul 17 22:06:59 <Exophase>	"for the same reason there are game studios for any platform. artists want contracts, especially pixel artists. people enjoy being involved with large projects."
Jul 17 22:07:03 <Exophase>	Heh, I knew he'd say something like that.....
Jul 17 22:07:33 <Exophase>	What a bunch of nonsense. You get hired by Nintendo because Nintendo has resources and brand appeal that you don't, he's starting from nothing..
Jul 17 22:11:07 <emusan>	and because they pay you a salary
Jul 17 22:11:16 <emusan>	you don't have to worry about sales...
Jul 17 22:17:34 -->	zippity (Mibbit@CD433FE8.78493BD0.8ABABB11.IP) has joined #nD
Jul 17 22:17:42 <zippity>	hello
Jul 17 22:18:15 <emusan>	hi
Jul 17 22:19:30 <zippity>	the nd looks really nice
Jul 17 22:19:49 <zippity>	is there been an exact release date given?
Jul 17 22:20:09 <emusan>	nope
Jul 17 22:20:24 <emusan>	there was supposed to be an SDK about a month ago though...
Jul 17 22:20:34 <emusan>	to give you an idea of Bob's release dates...
Jul 17 22:21:01 <zippity>	how many games are being ported?
Jul 17 22:21:31 <emusan>	uhh...
Jul 17 22:21:36 <emusan>	http://the-nd.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=2
Jul 17 22:21:41 <emusan>	I haven't made a count...
Jul 17 22:22:02 <emusan>	but those aren't exactly promises to port...
Jul 17 22:23:01 <zippity>	not bad
Jul 17 22:23:20 <zippity>	i love doom :)
Jul 17 22:23:56 <emusan>	I dunno if that will be ported anymore...
Jul 17 22:24:01 <itidus20>	have you seen html5 doom?
Jul 17 22:24:02 <zippity>	will there be a port of the terminator game from the snes
Jul 17 22:24:04 <emusan>	the guy doing it recently got very busy...
Jul 17 22:24:15 <emusan>	is there source code for that zippity?
Jul 17 22:24:25 <emusan>	I've seen the html5 quake 2 itidus20
Jul 17 22:24:32 <itidus20>	ooh
Jul 17 22:24:34 <emusan>	I'm more of a quake guy myself lol
Jul 17 22:24:52 <zippity>	emusan there should be unless it has to be cracked or remade
Jul 17 22:25:32 <emusan>	was it a commercial game?
Jul 17 22:25:45 <zippity>	yeah
Jul 17 22:26:05 <emusan>	then likely it can't be ported...
Jul 17 22:26:16 <zippity>	:/
Jul 17 22:26:24 <zippity>	i loved the terminator games
Jul 17 22:26:31 <zippity>	16 bit ones anyway
Jul 17 22:26:57 <itidus20>	I think the nD will certainly happen. The trick is to make it happen without it being infected by parasites of the corporate type.
Jul 17 22:27:00 <emusan>	we'll prolly get a snes emulator though anyway...
Jul 17 22:27:20 <emusan>	itidus20, do you know anything non-corporate that would risk millions of dollars on an angel investment?
Jul 17 22:27:31 <emusan>	without any kind of proof of concept even...
Jul 17 22:27:53 <emusan>	don't get me wrong, I /want/ to see it happen, I just don't see /how/ it will
Jul 17 22:28:05 <emusan>	especially with bob changing things about it every 5 minutes...
Jul 17 22:28:08 <itidus20>	im not saying corporate is inherently evil
Jul 17 22:28:21 <itidus20>	i am using the word in an inexact sense
Jul 17 22:28:54 <emusan>	I don't think Bob would see any corporation as good though...
Jul 17 22:29:06 <zippity>	its great the fact that it runs linux :)
Jul 17 22:29:11 <itidus20>	Bob's insanity is the only thing that could make something like this work.
Jul 17 22:29:14 <zippity>	im such a big linux fan boy
Jul 17 22:29:33 <itidus20>	Crazy shit does occasionally happen in this country of ours.
Jul 17 22:29:40 <itidus20>	He could be the Gandhi of gaming consoles.
Jul 17 22:29:49 <itidus20>	^planet of ours (im in australia)
Jul 17 22:30:06 <emusan>	I really don't view him that highly...
Jul 17 22:30:10 <emusan>	at least not lately...
Jul 17 22:30:19 <emusan>	He's promised so much but delivered so little...
Jul 17 22:30:23 <itidus20>	although i have heard arguments about how much of a role gandhi actually played.
Jul 17 22:30:35 <emusan>	and don't liken him to ghandi
Jul 17 22:30:45 <itidus20>	ghandi is overrated himself.
Jul 17 22:30:55 <itidus20>	verily
Jul 17 22:31:07 <emusan>	lol
Jul 17 22:31:09 <emusan>	explain?
Jul 17 22:31:09 <itidus20>	but the fact that 1 person can make a difference against all the odds
Jul 17 22:31:13 <itidus20>	that much is true
Jul 17 22:31:31 <emusan>	to "rate" ghandi is against his very nature...
Jul 17 22:31:40 <emusan>	and is rather insulting...
Jul 17 22:31:45 <itidus20>	i don't know the details..
Jul 17 22:32:08 <emusan>	lol, then don't say stuff like that...
Jul 17 22:32:16 <emusan>	I regard him highly...
Jul 17 22:32:24 <itidus20>	anyway
Jul 17 22:32:47 <itidus20>	if it's just another handheld, then the whole exercize becomes a failure
Jul 17 22:32:50 <emusan>	not to mention, if it weren't for ghandi's ideals, we might well not have had the civil rights movement...
Jul 17 22:33:01 <emusan>	okay... done...
Jul 17 22:33:15 <zippity>	will there be an sdk for linux operating systems?
Jul 17 22:33:17 <emusan>	 /if/ he can get it under $30 he will do well...
Jul 17 22:33:21 <zippity>	like ubuntu
Jul 17 22:33:31 <emusan>	zippity what are you asking?
Jul 17 22:33:36 <emusan>	you can produce apps for them many ways
Jul 17 22:33:39 <emusan>	thousands of ways
Jul 17 22:33:41 <itidus20>	theres more to it than the price of course
Jul 17 22:34:06 <emusan>	if its over $30 it /will/ fail though...
Jul 17 22:34:20 <emusan>	but if he doesn't start attracting dev's, it will also fail
Jul 17 22:34:33 <zippity>	will there be an sdk for ubuntu and other linux operating systems
Jul 17 22:34:33 <emusan>	and if he doesn't start focusing on the right market lol
Jul 17 22:34:39 <itidus20>	one difficult part is that, as far as I can tell, Bob doesn't want to get megarich. he has real goals.
Jul 17 22:34:43 <emusan>	zippity, you don't need an sdk...
Jul 17 22:35:16 <zippity>	you dont need an sdk to develop games for it?
Jul 17 22:35:18 <itidus20>	Theres a million business startups all looking to be bought out. The way I see it is he doesn't want to be bought.
Jul 17 22:35:26 <emusan>	zippity, no... not exactly
Jul 17 22:35:33 <emusan>	you use graphics libraries, etc.
Jul 17 22:35:37 <emusan>	and compile...
Jul 17 22:35:55 <emusan>	lol how do you think there are games on ubuntu and such now?
Jul 17 22:36:05 <itidus20>	The trouble is that the investors are looking to profit as much as possible. They could even be tempted to kick Bob out if he tries to get in the way of profit.
Jul 17 22:36:34 <zippity>	is the nd pattented
Jul 17 22:37:00 <emusan>	I don't think it is yet...
Jul 17 22:37:24 <itidus20>	The trouble with profit is that you have to jack up the prices as high as they can go in order to do it.
Jul 17 22:37:58 <emusan>	or sell a crap load of first party games lol
Jul 17 22:38:06 <itidus20>	But with consoles you can't exactly increase the price.
Jul 17 22:38:09 <zippity>	emusan:  so it can be redeveloped and re sold
Jul 17 22:38:09 <itidus20>	Noone does that.
Jul 17 22:38:27 <[]J>	 <itidus20> The trouble is that the investors are looking to profit as much as possible. They could even be tempted to kick Bob out if he tries to get in the way of profit.
Jul 17 22:38:29 <[]J>	haha good point
Jul 17 22:38:38 <emusan>	that would be epic...
Jul 17 22:38:43 <emusan>	bob getting kicked off the project...
Jul 17 22:38:46 <itidus20>	=))
Jul 17 22:38:54 <itidus20>	he would come back even more determined
Jul 17 22:38:57 <[]J>	bob's game ripped from his hands because he didn't carefully read the contract
Jul 17 22:39:06 <[]J>	(along with rights for the second game)
Jul 17 22:39:32 <emusan>	lol
Jul 17 22:40:20 <itidus20>	hmm
Jul 17 22:40:30 <itidus20>	That's the danger of dancing with investors.
Jul 17 22:41:32 <itidus20>	All he needs is a miracle.  It can happen.  It has happened.
Jul 17 22:42:04 <emusan>	has it happened to Bob?
Jul 17 22:42:24 <emusan>	the guy who was so insane nintendo wouldn't let him publish his game...
Jul 17 22:42:39 <emusan>	he needs one guy with a lot of money and the same mindset as him...
Jul 17 22:42:48 <emusan>	there aren't many of them though...
Jul 17 22:43:52 <--	zippity has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Jul 17 22:44:50 <itidus20>	The trouble is making sure his system doesn't end up just like all the others.
Jul 17 22:45:24 <itidus20>	I heard that Gunpei Yokoi at nintendo was a scapegoat for the virtual boy, got fired, and went off and created the wonderswan.
Jul 17 22:45:47 <itidus20>	Haven't actually read anything about said wonderswan.
Jul 17 22:46:20 <itidus20>	"The WonderSwan was made to compete with the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the market leader Nintendo's Game Boy Color (even though the developer for the WonderSwan, Gunpei Yokoi, developed the original Nintendo Game Boy)."
Jul 17 22:46:22 <[]J>	heh
Jul 17 22:47:58 <--	ChrisLenz has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 17 22:48:03 -->	ChrisLenz (~ChrisLenz@synIRC-BC580B5D.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #nD
Jul 17 22:48:23 <itidus20>	yeah im a bit of a trivia whore
Jul 17 22:55:26 <itidus20>	according to wiki, 14 months after leaving nintendo, gunpei crashed his car into a truck. when both drivers were inspecting the damage a third car killed him.
Jul 17 22:56:26 <[]J>	oh jeez
Jul 17 22:56:42 <[]J>	what a chump death :(
Jul 17 23:10:08 <Syniphas>	he also developed the virtual boy
Jul 17 23:18:16 <--	ChrisLenz has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 17 23:19:03 -->	ChrisLenz (~ChrisLenz@synIRC-BC580B5D.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #nD
Jul 17 23:28:16 <itidus20>	The trick with an ideal is that the ideal should be self-evident.
Jul 17 23:30:39 <Exophase>	If course nD runs Linux, like lots of other embedded stuff these days.. it doesn't mean that the device creators have good taste or are actively promoting open source or anything like that, Linux is the only really sane option.
Jul 17 23:32:34 <Exophase>	Although in nD's case you could sort of pull it off without a real OS at all.
Jul 17 23:32:51 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 23:33:10 <emusan>	I don't think he actually has linux under that firmware yet anyway...
Jul 17 23:33:15 <Exophase>	But then you'd have to do libraries for peripherals yourself.
Jul 17 23:33:22 <Exophase>	Oh, I think he has Linux.
Jul 17 23:33:28 <Exophase>	I think he has Linux because I think it uses SDL.
Jul 17 23:33:35 <emusan>	oh...
Jul 17 23:33:41 <emusan>	but why hide the text at bootup?
Jul 17 23:33:53 <emusan>	the output stuff...
Jul 17 23:34:00 <Exophase>	That output is often on serial instead of the LCD
Jul 17 23:34:12 <Exophase>	It is on the i.MX53 QSB for instance
Jul 17 23:34:23 <emusan>	yeah... but most distro's I've seen still output it to the screen...
Jul 17 23:34:23 <Exophase>	You still see the penguin though.
Jul 17 23:34:33 *	Exophase shrugs
Jul 17 23:34:53 <Exophase>	I doubt he's going out of his way to obscure it at this point.
Jul 17 23:35:02 <Exophase>	I dunno, it does boot really fast..
Jul 17 23:35:03 <emusan>	if it actually happens would you get one?
Jul 17 23:35:07 <Exophase>	An nD?
Jul 17 23:35:12 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 17 23:35:17 <emusan>	 /develop anything for it?
Jul 17 23:35:26 <Exophase>	The only reason I'd buy any device like this is to dev for it, but I'm not sure that'll be useful.
Jul 17 23:35:43 <Exophase>	Otherwise I have several other devices which will probably outclass it.. and I don't use this sort of thing anyway.
Jul 17 23:35:49 <Exophase>	(very much)
Jul 17 23:35:55 <Exophase>	I'm usually at a computer so no need for handhelds :/
Jul 17 23:35:58 <emusan>	true
Jul 17 23:36:04 <itidus20>	As for me this year I have no money. I couldn't even afford it at $10 right now. But I am the exception. I am an extreme outlier.
Jul 17 23:36:24 <emusan>	lol same
Jul 17 23:36:55 <Exophase>	But for something big and ergonomic (and powerful enough) I might go totally lazy and play it in bed or something.
Jul 17 23:36:55 <Exophase>	Geez itidus20, hard times huh
Jul 17 23:36:55 <Exophase>	I'll buy you an nD if you want. If it's REALLY released for $10-20.
Jul 17 23:37:15 <itidus20>	exophase: it's a tradeoff... my family takes care of me
Jul 17 23:37:39 <itidus20>	I don't have to work for now.
Jul 17 23:37:44 <Exophase>	Yeah, maybe one day your family will want you to take care of them instead.
Jul 17 23:37:47 <Exophase>	Not that there's anything bad about that.
Jul 17 23:37:50 <Exophase>	I take care of my mom now.
Jul 17 23:38:02 <itidus20>	I wish I didn't lose my temper so much.
Jul 17 23:38:06 <emusan>	my family takes care of me...
Jul 17 23:38:21 <itidus20>	It's not the family that causes it.
Jul 17 23:38:36 <itidus20>	It's all the parasites in the world festering in my thoughts.
Jul 17 23:38:51 <itidus20>	I don't have a strong mind.
Jul 17 23:38:55 <Exophase>	Mmn
Jul 17 23:39:00 <Exophase>	I can probably relate with that.
Jul 17 23:39:18 <itidus20>	But things are ok.
Jul 17 23:39:46 <itidus20>	I'm better without money.
Jul 17 23:39:59 <Exophase>	Really?
Jul 17 23:40:16 <itidus20>	can't bring myself to admit the sword swinging in terraria looks ridiculous
Jul 17 23:40:19 <emusan>	prolly the same with me...
Jul 17 23:40:28 <emusan>	lol I dislike terraria...
Jul 17 23:40:42 <emusan>	I'm bad-ish with money...
Jul 17 23:40:52 <itidus20>	i mean, whats with that freaking sword
Jul 17 23:41:07 <emusan>	lol never played terraria...
Jul 17 23:41:10 <itidus20>	imagine having to watch that for hours and hours
Jul 17 23:41:12 <emusan>	but the video's make it look rather dumb...
Jul 17 23:41:27 <itidus20>	the rest of the game... its something i wish i had $10 for
Jul 17 23:41:40 <itidus20>	but then would i play it, i ask myself
Jul 17 23:41:47 <itidus20>	would i be wasting valuable time playing it
Jul 17 23:42:05 <itidus20>	but blah.. its half baked i think
Jul 17 23:42:53 <itidus20>	i wanted minecraft for a while but slowly not caring
Jul 17 23:43:26 <emusan>	I liek minecraft...
Jul 17 23:43:27 <itidus20>	i'll only really feel satisfied by doing something with my time
Jul 17 23:43:37 <emusan>	one of my favorite games...
Jul 17 23:44:11 <itidus20>	I burned out years ago. Too many psychological issues caught up with me.
Jul 17 23:44:28 <itidus20>	A dude at a busstop called me hippie.
Jul 17 23:48:10 <emusan>	are you a hippie?
Jul 17 23:48:11 <itidus20>	not hard times cos i am well taken care of
Jul 17 23:48:24 <itidus20>	i guess so... but i don't have the gumption for that
Jul 17 23:48:34 <emusan>	lol
Jul 17 23:49:21 <itidus20>	i get stressed when i recieve money
Jul 17 23:49:33 <itidus20>	because like if i get $50 for a birthday my mom needs it
Jul 17 23:50:05 <itidus20>	so having to recieve it and part with it, while she lies the whole time about needing it, is too emotional
Jul 17 23:50:31 <Exophase>	That sucks.
Jul 17 23:50:44 <itidus20>	I mean, she pretends she doesn't need it.
Jul 17 23:50:48 <itidus20>	So i'm happy..
Jul 17 23:50:54 <itidus20>	But, money stings.
Jul 17 23:52:09 <itidus20>	And theres my brother who despite working is attached to her like a parasite.
Jul 17 23:52:22 <itidus20>	He can't help but take anything which he wants.
Jul 17 23:53:02 <itidus20>	He means well but he will never let her save money.
Jul 17 23:53:53 <itidus20>	But he pays for my internet so thats a bit hypocritical of me.
Jul 17 23:54:01 <itidus20>	And my mom pays for my food etc.
Jul 17 23:55:34 <itidus20>	The great paradox is that a person gets rich by not giving money away. No matter what they say they have to hold onto it.
Jul 17 23:56:18 <Exophase>	That's not really always true.
Jul 17 23:56:28 <Exophase>	There's always moderation.
Jul 17 23:56:35 <itidus20>	It's like, if a person has 4 slices of cake, they can't give their cake away and remain loaded with cake.
Jul 17 23:56:46 <itidus20>	its true i think in too extreme
Jul 17 23:56:50 <Exophase>	Unless they get six slices.
Jul 17 23:56:54 <Exophase>	Then they can give away two.
Jul 17 23:56:56 <Exophase>	And still have four.
Jul 17 23:57:09 <Exophase>	Many of the world's wealthiest people contribute a lot to charities.
Jul 17 23:57:12 <itidus20>	But there is a positive
Jul 17 23:57:21 <Exophase>	And I'm sure they didn't just start doing it once their bank accounts passed $1b
Jul 17 23:58:37 <itidus20>	You don't need a lot of money to buy goods and services. Soon the items are just expensive copies of other items special due to rarity.
Jul 17 23:59:20 <itidus20>	Like a car is just an engine and body and wheels etc.
Jul 17 23:59:37 <Exophase>	And a lot of money that has been put into developing it and testing it..
Jul 18 00:00:02 <itidus20>	But its over-developed if a car is 2million.
Jul 18 00:01:19 <Exophase>	I don't know what cars are 2 million.
Jul 18 00:01:25 <itidus20>	there is 1
Jul 18 00:01:30 <itidus20>	starts with a B if i recall
Jul 18 00:02:12 <itidus20>	seems to be Bugatti
Jul 18 00:03:13 <itidus20>	So, as the amount of money gets higher theres 2 ways it can be used (i admit i make a lot of this up naively) .. either for the raw power of being rich, or to make projects happen.
Jul 18 00:05:27 <itidus20>	It is possible that someone rich could encounter a project which means more to them than having money.
Jul 18 00:13:51 <itidus20>	It just occured to me that Bob could set up a charity on the side with a 10% nD, 10% charity, 80% developer scheme
Jul 18 00:14:24 <itidus20>	blah.
Jul 18 00:15:36 <emusan>	how is that a charity?
Jul 18 00:15:40 <emusan>	you mean a donation thing?
Jul 18 00:16:49 <itidus20>	I mean.. to set up a foundation on the side that uses that extra 10% to help causes
Jul 18 00:16:56 <itidus20>	well not a foundation actually
Jul 18 00:17:17 <itidus20>	just to give the money directly to the causes.. no red tape
Jul 18 00:17:26 <itidus20>	like, forget about tax relief
Jul 18 00:17:57 <itidus20>	most of the work a charity does is employ people to seek donations.
Jul 18 00:18:19 <emusan>	are you saying to do this before or after launch?
Jul 18 00:19:08 <itidus20>	Before.
Jul 18 00:19:24 <itidus20>	just with the sale of games.
Jul 18 00:19:44 <itidus20>	not for the console
Jul 18 00:21:39 <itidus20>	or if not something like that, perhaps setting some kind of legalities in place so that Bob's vision of the nD can't be displaced
Jul 18 00:22:20 <itidus20>	maybe the charity thing is best left as an after launch idea
Jul 18 00:22:43 <itidus20>	sorry guys.. i have little better to do than rant. I should chill out
Jul 18 00:23:35 <emusan>	lol
Jul 18 00:23:37 <emusan>	a bit...
Jul 18 00:24:28 <itidus20>	I'm looking at this all wrong.
Jul 18 00:24:59 <itidus20>	The investors simply need to see that the nD will become a household name like gameboy. And they'll be sold.
Jul 18 00:27:33 <emusan>	they also need to see a working prototype, and proof that it can in fact be made realistically for that price...
Jul 18 00:27:56 <itidus20>	Scale of economies.
Jul 18 00:28:04 <itidus20>	I don't know how that stuff works though.
Jul 18 00:28:05 <Exophase>	Gameboy became a household name because it was done by a company that was already a household name.
Jul 18 00:28:13 <Exophase>	And Nintendo hardly started with NES either.
Jul 18 00:28:44 <itidus20>	exophase: do you mean that part about how Bob is still an underground hit?
Jul 18 00:28:51 <Exophase>	What I believe is that technology from an unknown company with no money or connections only sells millions on its first product by being disruptive technology.
Jul 18 00:28:55 <Exophase>	Which I don't think the nD is at all.
Jul 18 00:29:05 <Exophase>	No, Bob isn't an underground anything ;p
Jul 18 00:29:11 <emusan>	Bob is not really an undrground hit..
Jul 18 00:29:24 <emusan>	if anything his past actions have hurt the nD
Jul 18 00:29:31 <Exophase>	He says his viral marketing for Bob's Game was very successful, I can't help but think it surely had plenty of negative effect too..
Jul 18 00:29:44 <itidus20>	hmm he's niche eh
Jul 18 00:29:54 <Exophase>	But that doesn't have that much to do with nD. Okay, Bob's Game itself will sell the nD and Bob's Game is one of the few things I have any confidence he can actually release.
Jul 18 00:29:59 <Exophase>	But that'll only go so far.
Jul 18 00:30:01 <emusan>	and just because he's an underground hit doesn't mean he'll sell a console well..
Jul 18 00:30:06 <emusan>	or make one welll for that matter...
Jul 18 00:30:17 <itidus20>	exophase, lol.. maybe one day Bob will be rendered with 3000 polys
Jul 18 00:30:26 <Exophase>	What I was saying before, is Nintendo is successful because they worked their way up to it.
Jul 18 00:30:51 <Exophase>	And I think this idea of being successful both in hardware and first party software is far fetched..
Jul 18 00:31:04 <Exophase>	When Nintendo is the only example of making that happen in the industry today. Even Sega backed out of that.
Jul 18 00:31:24 <Exophase>	Nintendo has the upper hand because they make hardware that helps maximize the appeal of their software.
Jul 18 00:31:28 <Exophase>	And have the momentum to do that.
Jul 18 00:36:32 <itidus20>	As Goku said before embarking on snake way.  If one guy can do it, two can do it.
Jul 18 00:36:36 <itidus20>	 =P
Jul 18 00:37:50 <Exophase>	Nintendo did it over the course of about 120 years.
Jul 18 00:38:17 <emusan>	lol yup
Jul 18 00:38:35 <emusan>	but of course the internet speeds things like this up a lot...
Jul 18 00:38:41 <itidus20>	I don't want to be too blindly praising though.
Jul 18 00:39:06 <itidus20>	This guy I chatted to. Gave me a lot of explanation about the ignorance in worship, and personality cults and such.
Jul 18 00:39:18 <itidus20>	That at the end of the day people are people.
Jul 18 00:39:37 <Exophase>	Mmmhmm
Jul 18 00:39:53 <itidus20>	smart motherfucker that guy
Jul 18 00:40:21 <Exophase>	Sounds like he's on to something.
Jul 18 00:40:27 <itidus20>	anyway, it worries me how I might just put Bob on a pedestal too high.
Jul 18 00:40:49 <itidus20>	It's bad for me to think in that way.
Jul 18 00:40:58 <emusan>	yes... it is...
Jul 18 00:41:26 <emusan>	read the forums for about a week though and you'll see where we all are coming from...
Jul 18 00:41:49 <emusan>	he's changed his mind a lot since I started following the project...
Jul 18 00:42:18 <itidus20>	nD is something a lot of people want to happen.
Jul 18 00:42:27 <itidus20>	he is just the guy who will make it happen
Jul 18 00:42:41 <emusan>	I dunno...
Jul 18 00:42:46 <emusan>	I want it to happen as well...
Jul 18 00:42:54 <Exophase>	Almost everything is something a some number of people want to happen. He wants to sell millions. So it'd better be something millions of people want to happen.
Jul 18 00:43:03 <Exophase>	s/a some/some/
Jul 18 00:43:04 <Exophase>	bluhh
Jul 18 00:43:08 <emusan>	but I'm not one to take something like this on blind faith...
Jul 18 00:43:41 <itidus20>	with the nD concept established... people would still want it to happen even if Bob backed off on it
Jul 18 00:43:44 <itidus20>	it's a solid idea
Jul 18 00:44:39 <itidus20>	The thing is to make it happen before someone greedy does.
Jul 18 00:45:03 <itidus20>	Also.. very very importantly is preventing patents being made for stuff like this
Jul 18 00:45:52 <itidus20>	I mean, sure nD could get patents.
Jul 18 00:46:08 <itidus20>	But I mean you don't want some patent troll getting em first.
Jul 18 00:46:25 <Exophase>	What exactly is even patentable about nD?
Jul 18 00:46:30 <Exophase>	I don't get what the big new concept is.
Jul 18 00:46:41 <emusan>	I don't think anything is...
Jul 18 00:46:42 <itidus20>	Patents don't have to be patentable.
Jul 18 00:46:47 <emusan>	its almost the same as the Dingoo...
Jul 18 00:46:53 <itidus20>	The system is corrupt.
Jul 18 00:46:55 <emusan>	lol IBM tried to patent the patent system...
Jul 18 00:47:07 <emusan>	it didn't go through, but was funny anyway...
Jul 18 00:47:13 <Exophase>	I don't see what they stand to gain from patenting.
Jul 18 00:47:22 <itidus20>	Prior art is more important in blocking a patent than being patentable.
Jul 18 00:47:24 <emusan>	same...
Jul 18 00:47:36 <Exophase>	If they actually manage to get one filed, and it'll take forever, in order to not conflict with existing ones it'll have to be so vague that it's not enforcing anything.
Jul 18 00:48:07 <itidus20>	Yeah, it's best to just demonstrate the prior art so that noone steals the idea.
Jul 18 00:48:21 <Exophase>	What is there to steal on nD?
Jul 18 00:48:23 <itidus20>	I heard patent clerks will steal patents sometimes.
Jul 18 00:48:32 <Exophase>	The design verbatim?
Jul 18 00:48:41 <Exophase>	I mean, an exact aesthetic clone?
Jul 18 00:49:04 <Exophase>	An exact clone would probably not even hurt him. Not sure why anyone would want to do one though.
Jul 18 00:49:12 <itidus20>	exactly...
Jul 18 00:49:15 <itidus20>	it wouldn't
Jul 18 00:49:18 <itidus20>	he would like it probably
Jul 18 00:49:53 <itidus20>	however, if someone else held patents that prevented creation of nD .. they would likely jack up the prices and scare off indies
Jul 18 00:50:16 <itidus20>	Another danger is submerged patents.
Jul 18 00:50:29 <Exophase>	No one will try to stop nD from being created, there are way too many other devices like this that no one attempted to bar.
Jul 18 00:51:09 <itidus20>	Is custom graphics hardware a possibility? I assume it would be too much of a mess
Jul 18 00:51:23 <itidus20>	would raise prices
Jul 18 00:51:55 <itidus20>	Well, the nD of course is partially a political statement to show how much of a ripoff the other handhelds are
Jul 18 00:52:06 <pandabear41>	What would you use the hardware graphics for? 3D stuff?
Jul 18 00:52:08 <emusan>	your looking far too much into this...
Jul 18 00:52:09 <itidus20>	To demonstrate what the cost to build actually is
Jul 18 00:52:18 <itidus20>	no.. 2d stuff
Jul 18 00:52:19 <emusan>	pandabear, your here!
Jul 18 00:52:34 <itidus20>	custom 2d hardware could be nifty
Jul 18 00:52:35 <pandabear41>	Yah, got done with my nightly dota.
Jul 18 00:52:41 <emusan>	lol other handhelds really aren't a ripoff...
Jul 18 00:52:50 <itidus20>	emu, =))
Jul 18 00:52:55 <itidus20>	=))
Jul 18 00:53:06 <itidus20>	blasphemy
Jul 18 00:53:43 <itidus20>	i thought the gba was very cool anyway
Jul 18 00:53:43 <emusan>	if you buy from sony/nintendo you get real, first party support...
Jul 18 00:53:47 <Exophase>	The possibility of ANY custom logic is pretty much zero.
Jul 18 00:53:56 <pandabear41>	It would be nice, I would prefer a faster cpu instead. Its cheaper than grfx hardware. It can do about the same thing as grfx hardware.
Jul 18 00:53:58 <Exophase>	Every IC will be off the shelf.
Jul 18 00:53:58 <itidus20>	exophase, yeah thats cool
Jul 18 00:54:17 <itidus20>	panda: sweet
Jul 18 00:54:32 <Exophase>	Anyway in this day and age you wouldn't want discrete graphics in a handheld, separate from the chip that has the CPU and peripherals.
Jul 18 00:54:39 <Exophase>	That'd be a big disadvantge.
Jul 18 00:54:43 <Exophase>	.. disadvantage
Jul 18 00:55:38 <pandabear41>	In the arm perspective a 800MHz cpu is only $2.5 more than the 400MHz.
Jul 18 00:55:47 <Exophase>	An 800MHz what?
Jul 18 00:55:54 <Exophase>	What are you comparing here?
Jul 18 00:56:05 <Exophase>	You don't buy ARM CPUs, you buy SoCs
Jul 18 00:56:10 <Exophase>	Or microcontrollers at the lower end.
Jul 18 00:56:36 <pandabear41>	Well bob is using an ARM for the proto. :P
Jul 18 00:57:23 <itidus20>	every $ adds up though of course
Jul 18 00:58:25 <emusan>	lol CVMagic just made a great point...
Jul 18 00:58:45 <emusan>	if people can only afford $10 for a console, how would they afford to spend money on the games?
Jul 18 00:58:57 <emusan>	and then what reason would big developers have?
Jul 18 01:01:08 <Exophase>	pandabear41; Just trying to figure out what 400MHz and 800MHz ARMs you are compring.
Jul 18 01:01:10 <Exophase>	.. comparing
Jul 18 01:01:29 <pandabear41>	Sec, let me pull the site back up.
Jul 18 01:01:33 <Exophase>	Because for one thing those won't even be the same CPU type..
Jul 18 01:09:12 <pandabear41>	NM, I was looking at the wrong f***** page. Its $2.5 more for a 533MHx.
Jul 18 01:09:26 <Exophase>	A 533MHz what?
Jul 18 01:09:30 <Exophase>	What are you looking at!
Jul 18 01:09:41 <pandabear41>	digikey.com
Jul 18 01:09:45 <Exophase>	Argh, no
Jul 18 01:09:48 <Exophase>	What parts.
Jul 18 01:10:23 <pandabear41>	One of the ARM9 and the ARM11 parts in the 1000 piece price.
Jul 18 01:13:15 <Exophase>	From what?
Jul 18 01:13:28 <Exophase>	Maybe you should just link both.
Jul 18 01:37:29 <emusan>	well... its time I got to bed...

Jul 18 16:56:10 <happycow>	Hello.
Jul 18 16:56:40 <Stryker001>	hey there
Jul 18 16:56:50 <Stryker001>	this is for the nD development system, right?
Jul 18 16:57:23 <happycow>	yes.
Jul 18 16:57:37 <Stryker001>	coolio
Jul 18 16:59:55 <Stryker001>	anyone here made anything for it yet?
Jul 18 17:05:00 <happycow>	I ported a few games. I am in the middle of making a RPG game and something else that I will not speak of.
Jul 18 17:05:59 <Stryker001>	Sorry for being unclear. What I was trying to ask was, has anyone made anything exclusively for it? Like, no ports/clones/mods?
Jul 18 17:07:01 <happycow>	My RPG game and my other project is exclusively for the nD.
Jul 18 17:07:05 <happycow>	:P
Jul 18 17:07:19 <Stryker001>	nice!
Jul 18 17:08:08 <Stryker001>	I haven't come up with any *exclusive* games, but I am working on two that, while they aren't clones, they won't cause *any* copyright violations. :P
Jul 18 17:08:24 <--	happycow has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Jul 18 17:08:55 <itidus21>	I'm more or less here my first time. [so i'm not confused for a reg]. I think it's actually far more rewarding to not touch copyrighted stuff.

Jul 18 17:09:44 <itidus21>	gameplay is another thing altogether. it's basically genre.s
Jul 18 17:10:16 <--	JosJuice (~JosJuice@synIRC-25B2959E.fagotten.org) has left #nD
Jul 18 17:10:29 <Stryker001>	yeah, original content is awesome, but when you have a brilliant idea for an 8-bit (or 4-bit, actually) version of Super Smash Bros for the nD, it's impossible not to work on it. :P
Jul 18 17:11:05 <itidus21>	everything has genres: music(country, rap, techno, etc), novels(romance, thriller, ??), movies(mystery, drama, war, i dunno)
Jul 18 17:11:22 <itidus21>	games (platformer, shooter, racing, sport, puzzle)
Jul 18 17:12:17 <itidus21>	ya. u may be right
Jul 18 17:14:23 <Stryker001>	right, but SSBB (Wii) has a story mode that can be considered Platformer. That doesn't mean it's not original because Super Mario Bros came out first. you know?
Jul 18 17:16:47 <itidus21>	well yeah thats what i mean, you can still be very original operating within a genre
Jul 18 17:17:18 <itidus21>	the moment someone creates a protection against working within a genre then you know something is wrong
Jul 18 17:19:18 <Stryker001>	lol yeha
Jul 18 17:19:20 <Stryker001>	*yeah
Jul 18 17:19:23 <itidus21>	yup
Jul 18 17:19:42 <itidus21>	a person shouldn't really need to create a new genre just to feel original
Jul 18 17:20:33 <Stryker001>	'cuz like you can never make a completely original maze game, because mazes have been around for many years. But if Activision, say, decided to copyright maze games, then I think there would be some major lawsuits. :P
Jul 18 17:20:55 <Stryker001>	and it's pretty hard to make something that is fun, playable, and doesn't fall into any standard genres.
Jul 18 17:20:57 <Stryker001>	IMHO
Jul 18 17:22:12 <itidus21>	well genres aren't fixed in shape
Jul 18 17:22:20 <itidus21>	they're jelly-like.
Jul 18 17:22:30 <itidus21>	Im making this up as I go
Jul 18 17:22:32 <Stryker001>	true
Jul 18 17:22:35 <Stryker001>	lol
Jul 18 17:23:01 <Stryker001>	but most things that are actually fun to play fall into a basic category (action, puzzle, etc.)
Jul 18 17:23:06 <itidus21>	So you have the set of all things called 'games'. And for purposes of categorization you divide it up like a cake into categories.
Jul 18 17:23:40 <itidus21>	So a game gets assigned to the category which is it's closest match.
Jul 18 17:23:54 <Stryker001>	right
Jul 18 17:23:54 <itidus21>	Or sometimes it is a hybrid so it has multiple genres.
Jul 18 17:24:18 <Stryker001>	it's kinda hard to create an extra slice of the cake--one different than the others,
Jul 18 17:24:34 <itidus21>	Yeah. That would be like founding a new country within europe.
Jul 18 17:25:11 <itidus21>	Not a perfect analogy though.
Jul 18 17:25:23 <Stryker001>	lol yeah
Jul 18 17:25:26 <Stryker001>	I get what you mean
Jul 18 17:25:35 <Stryker001>	we should totally come up with a new category though
Jul 18 17:25:43 <Stryker001>	*genre
Jul 18 17:25:46 <Stryker001>	it would be fun
Jul 18 17:26:54 <itidus21>	according to wikipedia, genre comes from a french word meaning "kind" or "sort"
Jul 18 17:27:14 <itidus21>	which are clearly synonyms for category
Jul 18 17:27:19 <Stryker001>	right
Jul 18 17:28:56 <itidus21>	yeah that wiki page is actually pretty indepth :-s
Jul 18 17:29:12 <Stryker001>	some pages are
Jul 18 17:30:56 <itidus21>	I don't think I drank enough coffee to read this page. But I wanna read the whole thing.
Jul 18 17:31:03 <itidus21>	Time for a coffee.
Jul 18 17:31:39 <Stryker001>	:)
Jul 18 17:31:44 <Stryker001>	what time is it in your area?
Jul 18 17:34:34 <Stryker001>	hmmm, 4bits = 16 colors. Awesome!
Jul 18 17:35:13 <Stryker001>	Tiny pallette!
Jul 18 17:36:35 <itidus21>	7:35am
Jul 18 17:36:44 <itidus21>	4bits = CGA
Jul 18 17:36:49 <itidus21>	hehe
Jul 18 17:37:02 <itidus21>	but CGA has a tedious pallette
Jul 18 17:37:19 <itidus21>	I'm sure you could have a better pallette
Jul 18 17:37:38 <Stryker001>	cga?
Jul 18 17:37:47 <itidus21>	Old school PC graphics
Jul 18 17:38:07 <Stryker001>	ah
Jul 18 17:38:11 <itidus21>	when i was born they didnt have super vga
Jul 18 17:38:44 <itidus21>	my first PC had 4 bit graphics
Jul 18 17:38:47 <Stryker001>	yeah, I was thinking of doing an 8-bit graphic system for one of the nD games I'm working on, but I think 4-bit will work better (and be awesomer!!!)
Jul 18 17:38:48 <Stryker001>	lol
Jul 18 17:39:09 <Stryker001>	didn't MSDOS only like have 8-bit graphics?
Jul 18 17:39:43 <itidus21>	to make matters worse there was a loose wire in the monitor so it occasionally lost the blue colors
Jul 18 17:39:58 <itidus21>	well something like that
Jul 18 17:40:04 <itidus21>	i forget
Jul 18 17:40:15 <itidus21>	some colors missing anyway
Jul 18 17:40:16 <Stryker001>	ah
Jul 18 17:40:20 <Stryker001>	bad wiring is bad
Jul 18 17:40:28 <Stryker001>	I had an RGB cable like that
Jul 18 17:40:38 <itidus21>	nah ... DOS didn't start out with 8bit
Jul 18 17:40:43 <Stryker001>	I would go back and forth between only shades of green/purple
Jul 18 17:40:43 <Stryker001>	lol
Jul 18 17:40:44 <itidus21>	I dunno exactly how it went
Jul 18 17:40:50 <Stryker001>	some internal short :(
Jul 18 17:40:58 <itidus21>	oh maybe it did
Jul 18 17:40:59 <Stryker001>	I suppose Google would know, or WIki lol
Jul 18 17:41:00 <itidus21>	who am i to say
Jul 18 17:41:21 <itidus21>	CGA = 16colors, EGA = 64 colors, VGA = 256 colors
Jul 18 17:41:38 <itidus21>	SVGA = moar and moar
Jul 18 17:42:09 <Stryker001>	lol yeah
Jul 18 17:42:12 <Stryker001>	HDMI ftw
Jul 18 17:42:52 <Stryker001>	ever head of Tank Wars?
Jul 18 17:42:55 <Stryker001>	old DOS game
Jul 18 17:42:57 <itidus21>	no
Jul 18 17:43:04 <itidus21>	oh i love the old dos games
Jul 18 17:43:11 <itidus21>	ive got dosbox installed
Jul 18 17:43:35 <Stryker001>	nice
Jul 18 17:44:09 <itidus21>	back then i was the only one in the house who really gave a damn about the PC
Jul 18 17:44:14 <Stryker001>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Wars
Jul 18 17:44:17 <itidus21>	it was just a toy
Jul 18 17:44:20 <Stryker001>	ah
Jul 18 17:44:21 <Stryker001>	?
Jul 18 17:44:27 <Stryker001>	* :)
Jul 18 17:45:17 <itidus21>	(according to wiki) 8086 = 5 - 10mhz
Jul 18 17:45:29 <Stryker001>	wow
Jul 18 17:45:31 <itidus21>	1mb ram if i recall
Jul 18 17:45:36 <Stryker001>	nice
Jul 18 17:45:41 <itidus21>	20mb hard disk
Jul 18 17:45:52 <itidus21>	16 colors (or less.. due to loose wire)
Jul 18 17:46:24 <itidus21>	and it took like a minute to check the ram for errors
Jul 18 17:46:54 <Stryker001>	yep...
Jul 18 17:47:27 <itidus21>	no soundcard.. just a pc speaker
Jul 18 17:47:36 <itidus21>	although soundcards may have existed we didn't have one
Jul 18 17:47:57 <itidus21>	curiously it had tv out
Jul 18 17:48:09 <Stryker001>	yeah, that sounds about right
Jul 18 17:48:15 <itidus21>	most importantly it had qbasic
Jul 18 17:49:08 <Stryker001>	cool
Jul 18 17:49:11 <Stryker001>	and no gui
Jul 18 17:49:13 <Stryker001>	:)
Jul 18 17:49:28 <itidus21>	x tree gold
Jul 18 17:50:17 <Stryker001>	:D
Jul 18 17:50:25 <Stryker001>	that sounds like a lot of fun
Jul 18 17:50:26 <Stryker001>	lol
Jul 18 17:50:43 <itidus21>	text based gui
Jul 18 17:50:55 <Stryker001>	yep
Jul 18 17:50:58 <Stryker001>	well
Jul 18 17:51:12 <Stryker001>	it wasn't really a *graphical* user interface if it only had text
Jul 18 17:51:20 <Stryker001>	unless it used ASCII to draw stuff lol
Jul 18 17:51:24 <itidus21>	heres sort of how it looked: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Xtreegold-3.0.png
Jul 18 17:52:24 <Stryker001>	niiiiiiiice
Jul 18 17:52:40 <Stryker001>	that's what my BIOS looks like (Minus DOOM2, of course) lol
Jul 18 17:52:58 <itidus21>	its so long ago i can't remember if we had xtree gold on the 8086 or the 286
Jul 18 17:54:33 <itidus21>	on the 286 or whatever we eventually got a graphical GUI called QuikMenu

Jul 19 17:53:46 <pandabear41>	freenode and mibbit are two different things. freenode is an irc server/hub. mibbit is an online irc client.
Jul 19 17:54:36 <Stryker001>	ah. that explains a lot...

Jul 19 22:42:11 <MPQC>	It has buttons -_-
Jul 19 22:42:55 <Exophase>	Did you make a new thread for this that got deleted?
Jul 19 22:43:22 <MPQC>	No, I posted it under his firmware thread
Jul 19 22:43:31 <Exophase>	Did he remove your post?
Jul 19 22:43:43 <MPQC>	Yeah
Jul 19 22:43:50 <Exophase>	And banned you.
Jul 19 22:43:50 <MPQC>	"Your forum account is currently banned. Ban Reason: that's pretty funny. i used a HD Sony camcorder though"
Jul 19 22:43:52 <Exophase>	That's pretty weird.
Jul 19 22:44:11 <Exophase>	But you weren't trying to be funny right?
Jul 19 22:44:30 <MPQC>	Oh I did make a joke in the post, but wasn't thinking ban worthy
Jul 19 22:44:52 <Exophase>	What was the joke?
Jul 19 22:45:19 <MPQC>	That I used a bad camera and filmed in darkness so it was hard to see
Jul 19 22:45:36 <MPQC>	Darkness and camera not included in release ;)
Jul 19 22:45:45 <Exophase>	Man, he has no sense of humor.
Jul 19 22:45:59 <MPQC>	I thought it was funny :|
Jul 19 22:46:22 <MPQC>	One of those mods up there probably has a copy of the post, it was probably only soft deleted (though I can't say for sure)
Jul 19 22:46:28 <Exophase>	It's bad enough when you get a forum tyrant, but it's especially bad when it's for an official board for a product.
Jul 19 22:47:29 <MPQC>	But still I want to be unbanned :\
Jul 19 22:47:42 <Exophase>	I think at least someone here is a mod.
Jul 19 22:54:16 <MPQC>	Om nom nom
Jul 19 22:56:09 <MPQC>	On a more positive note, this is my moment
Jul 19 22:56:40 <Exophase>	Congratulations? e_e
Jul 19 22:57:22 <MPQC>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OxWD85Ngz4
Jul 19 22:57:25 <MPQC>	Obviously didn't catch that...
Jul 19 22:58:08 <Exophase>	She did MORE music? Geez.
Jul 19 22:58:42 <Exophase>	Heh, it's a song directly celebrating her mediocrity
Jul 19 22:58:55 <MPQC>	She tells off all the hates at the start
Jul 19 22:58:59 <MPQC>	Brilliant start :P
Jul 19 23:03:46 <MPQC>	None of you would happen to have a Dingoo A380 would you?
Jul 19 23:05:10 <Exophase>	Never even heard of it, was it just released?
Jul 19 23:05:35 <Exophase>	Looks like a pretty incremental update to the original.
Jul 19 23:05:45 <Exophase>	What's with those colored buttons..
Jul 19 23:05:56 <MPQC>	Those colored buttons are fucking sexy
Jul 19 23:06:14 <MPQC>	Yeah it's a new release, very few people have one
Jul 19 23:06:17 <Exophase>	To each their own.
Jul 19 23:06:36 <MPQC>	http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00jCPEJSMsyOkQ/Electronic-Handheld-Game-Player-Dingoo-A380-.jpg
Jul 19 23:06:39 <MPQC>	How can you say it's not sexy :P
Jul 19 23:06:57 <Exophase>	Yeeeah
Jul 19 23:08:05 <MPQC>	Comes preinstalled with Dingux though, so you can't beat it
Jul 19 23:08:20 <MPQC>	Saves you the 5 mins of installing it
Jul 19 23:08:32 <Exophase>	Can't beat it on what terms? I'm sure it's better than buying the original, although it appears to be more expensive too.
Jul 19 23:09:14 <Exophase>	The CPU looks the same except with a separate core that I doubt much will use.
Jul 19 23:09:15 <MPQC>	Beta reviews say it's garbage in terms of emulation
Jul 19 23:09:27 <MPQC>	Eh...CPU's 100MHz faster
Jul 19 23:09:31 <Exophase>	And overclocked I guess.
Jul 19 23:09:34 <Exophase>	Yeah, overclocked >_>
Jul 19 23:09:53 <MPQC>	That little sucker must heat up fast if it's overclocked
Jul 19 23:10:03 <Exophase>	Nah, probably the original spec was just too conservative.
Jul 19 23:10:23 <MPQC>	I put my A320 to 400Mhz (it's "default"), and that thing gets pretty hot
Jul 19 23:10:45 <Exophase>	So does it have wifi or what?
Jul 19 23:10:57 <Exophase>	Not seeing it listed every time.
Jul 19 23:11:06 <MPQC>	Pretty sure it does, let me check the list
Jul 19 23:11:26 <Exophase>	I'm looking at dingoo-digital-usa's site, which I presume to be about the best English reference you'll get.
Jul 19 23:11:33 <Exophase>	"Reciever: Internal 2.4GHz reciever module that supports two wireless game controller for tv-out and wireless link between to Dingoo-Tech A380 consoles."
Jul 19 23:11:36 <MPQC>	"Receiver: Internal 2.4GHz receiver module that supports two wireless game controller for tv-out and wireless link between to Dingoo-Tech A380 consoles."
Jul 19 23:11:40 <MPQC>	Damn ninja's these days
Jul 19 23:11:43 <Exophase>	That does not sound like wifi.
Jul 19 23:11:56 <MPQC>	At least it's got multiplayer :\
Jul 19 23:11:59 -->	AkumaStreak (~AkumaStre@synIRC-AB4AB36C.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #nD
Jul 19 23:12:00 <Exophase>	That sounds pretty useless ;p
Jul 19 23:12:07 <Exophase>	Yeah, multiplayer if the two people are in the same room.
Jul 19 23:12:11 <Exophase>	Not over the internet.
Jul 19 23:12:19 <MPQC>	I'd totally play multiplayer with myself on my A320
Jul 19 23:12:23 <Exophase>	Yeah.
Jul 19 23:12:36 <Exophase>	You know very well that you'll never find another person with this.
Jul 19 23:12:41 <Exophase>	So with yourself indeed ;p
Jul 19 23:12:57 <MPQC>	Touche
Jul 19 23:13:06 <MPQC>	I'll convince my entire university to buy one
Jul 19 23:13:44 <Exophase>	Also ugh, 400x240
Jul 19 23:13:49 <Exophase>	I'm surprised they even sell that.
Jul 19 23:14:05 <MPQC>	The perfect resolution for emulation LOL
Jul 19 23:14:22 <Exophase>	You're being sarcastic right?
Jul 19 23:14:31 <MPQC>	Obviously
Jul 19 23:14:50 <Exophase>	So it has 2x the RAM, more CPU, worse resolution, dubious wireless functions..
Jul 19 23:14:53 <Exophase>	NAND is increased?
Jul 19 23:15:12 <MPQC>	NAND Is same
Jul 19 23:15:22 <MPQC>	Though on A320 you can select 2gb, 4gb, 8gb
Jul 19 23:15:22 <Exophase>	Looks like a pretty mixed bag.. worth buying if you don't have an A320 but nothing to get very excited over.
Jul 19 23:16:03 <MPQC>	I wish they had done a 4:3 resolution
Jul 19 23:16:37 <Exophase>	Is it the same size as the A320?
Jul 19 23:16:41 <MPQC>	Yeah
Jul 19 23:16:50 <Exophase>	So the screen has less height..
Jul 19 23:16:59 <MPQC>	I think
Jul 19 23:17:25 <Exophase>	Wait they did multiplayer for GBA??
Jul 19 23:17:35 <MPQC>	It's a bit bigger
Jul 19 23:17:47 <MPQC>	NOt sure
Jul 19 23:17:58 <Exophase>	That'd be surprising.
Jul 19 23:18:10 <MPQC>	There's really no reviews so we don't know
Jul 19 23:18:52 <MPQC>	I'd assume so at least though
Jul 19 23:21:44 <Exophase>	Well, they claim it here
Jul 19 23:21:44 <Exophase>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GKto_-RsyE
Jul 19 23:21:48 <Exophase>	But I don't believe it until I see it.
Jul 19 23:22:02 <MPQC>	That guys video is so boring
Jul 19 23:22:09 <MPQC>	Do love his store though
Jul 19 23:22:14 <Exophase>	Tell me about it.
Jul 19 23:23:47 <MPQC>	They play multiplayer in the vid :P
Jul 19 23:24:21 <Exophase>	I know. But not GBA.

Jul 20 14:28:21 <coolty>	wow, Exophase is in here
Jul 20 14:28:57 <coolty>	anyway I just came here to say that you should really reconsider having some sort of SD storage, either user-accesible or under a few screws.
Jul 20 14:31:24 <AkumaStreak>	this thing's gotta ship in cracker jack boxes sir
Jul 20 14:32:01 <coolty>	i don't see how it will ship in anything so far
Jul 20 14:32:11 <coolty>	i've not even seen a prototype of the hardware
Jul 20 14:39:05 <MPQC>	Nobody has
Jul 20 14:40:35 <coolty>	yeah... about that...
Jul 20 14:43:11 <coolty>	"we'll use whatever LCD we can get cheapest" kinda makes me wonder about the competency of bob on hardware
Jul 20 14:43:21 <Treeki>	quantity > quality, obviously
Jul 20 14:44:23 <coolty>	in this case it seems that to be true
Jul 20 14:54:31 <AkumaStreak>	roll your own as they say
Jul 20 14:55:00 <AkumaStreak>	i think it should be one or the other if i were to make a 2D system
Jul 20 14:55:24 <AkumaStreak>	completely and utterly discardable or something that feels like a generation step over the neo-geo/snes/dreamcast's 2D abilities
Jul 20 14:55:32 <AkumaStreak>	that basically does every damn thing you could ever want from the 2D space
Jul 20 14:55:52 <AkumaStreak>	which you prob. couldn't make for under $100 or $200
Jul 20 14:58:06 <coolty>	correct
Jul 20 14:58:10 <coolty>	prototypes always cost more
Jul 20 14:58:16 <coolty>	mass production costs less.

Jul 20 17:04:26 <Kutagh>	nope pandabear41 
Jul 20 17:05:15 <coolty>	IMHO just ignore the nD project until it's released
Jul 20 17:05:37 <Kutagh>	or at least hardware specs are finalized
Jul 20 17:05:42 <coolty>	no SD support of any kind, the worst (read: cheapest) screen he can get ahold of, etc
Jul 20 17:05:43 <pandabear41>	lol
Jul 20 17:10:00 <itidus21>	if it can display 320x240 in color, it is enough :D
Jul 20 17:10:23 <coolty>	is it?
Jul 20 17:10:42 <coolty>	you don't care if it's impossible to read in sunlight or if the refresh rate sucks and there is screen tearing?
Jul 20 17:11:18 <coolty>	most "cell phone LCD screens" will have horrible refresh rates.
Jul 20 17:12:19 <Kutagh>	30Hz is fine for most handheld games tbh
Jul 20 17:13:00 <Kutagh>	the (onscreen) fast-paced action ones generally arent quite suitable for handheld games
Jul 20 17:13:11 <coolty>	like bob's game?
Jul 20 17:13:16 <coolty>	;)
Jul 20 17:13:21 <Kutagh>	bob sucks so :p

Jul 20 17:13:40 <Kutagh>	and sunlight....
Jul 20 17:13:49 <Kutagh>	afaik almost all handhelds do have that issue
Jul 20 17:14:00 <coolty>	you've never owned a gp32 have you?
Jul 20 17:14:01 <Kutagh>	afaik even ipads and such
Jul 20 17:14:03 <Kutagh>	nope
Jul 20 17:14:12 <Kutagh>	but I said, almost all.
Jul 20 17:14:16 <coolty>	=D
Jul 20 17:14:30 <Kutagh>	I've owned a gameboy, gameboy color, gameboy advanced, PSP
Jul 20 17:14:50 <Kutagh>	afaik those all had the same issue with sunlight (though the original gameboy less so due to the green/black screen :p)
Jul 20 17:15:14 <coolty>	you can see the gameboy color in direct sunlight
Jul 20 17:15:28 <coolty>	in fact, you NEEDED it
Jul 20 17:15:37 <Kutagh>	only a couple games needed it :p
Jul 20 17:15:47 <coolty>	like pokemon
Jul 20 17:16:04 <Kutagh>	dont recall that tbh
Jul 20 17:16:05 <itidus21>	most people put up with screen tearing on pc
Jul 20 17:16:14 <Kutagh>	but then I dont really play pokemon :p
Jul 20 17:16:22 <itidus21>	for my part i find it horrible
Jul 20 17:17:18 <itidus21>	ok its not true most people put up with it
Jul 20 17:17:29 <itidus21>	but its like noone even really acknowledges it
Jul 20 17:18:38 <Mr_Gnome>	I've never really had screen tearing... but then again I use 2D graphics and GNU/Linux... I hardly play any games
Jul 20 17:18:39 <coolty>	what are you talking about
Jul 20 17:18:42 <coolty>	yeah 
Jul 20 17:18:47 <coolty>	i never get screen tearing
Jul 20 17:18:54 <coolty>	except full screen youtube on linux
Jul 20 17:19:00 <coolty>	but that's because flash doesn't like linux
Jul 20 17:19:24 <Mr_Gnome>	I don't even use Flash (nor java)
Jul 20 17:19:30 <coolty>	:o
Jul 20 17:22:00 <Mr_Gnome>	I know when your using Ubuntu 11.04 + with proprietary nvidia drivers every time you minimize an application the screen tears alot
Jul 20 17:23:24 <itidus21>	im a winxp user.. I hear things like you can barely notice it in 3d games.
Jul 20 17:24:30 <itidus21>	but its just kinda messy i find
Jul 20 17:24:33 <Mr_Gnome>	are you seriously surprised someone doesn't use flash or java? Their terribly bloated things...
Jul 20 17:25:03 <Mr_Gnome>	Yeah the only game I play anymore is either games I'm making or AoE2:TC
Jul 20 17:25:24 <itidus21>	like dos vga vs opengl vs directdraw vs direct3d probably all take unique approaches to combatting screen tea
Jul 20 17:25:26 <itidus21>	^tear
Jul 20 17:25:31 <Kutagh>	the only tearing I've encountered so far is when switching resolution/orientation and alt-tabbing :p
Jul 20 17:28:19 <itidus21>	yeah i guess im making a fuss about nothing
Jul 20 17:28:35 <Kutagh>	not necessarily
Jul 20 17:28:49 <itidus21>	well its uhh
Jul 20 17:29:05 <itidus21>	its like theres only a virtual stability
Jul 20 17:29:31 <itidus21>	but when things go wrong things like screen tearing can happen on some random pc
Jul 20 17:31:29 <itidus21>	the fact that everyone has unique drivers and unique hardware, and configured their direct3d or opengl or whatever gnu/linux has in their own way
Jul 20 17:32:12 <itidus21>	occasionally things have to go wrong
Jul 20 17:32:14 <Kutagh>	yea
Jul 20 17:32:49 <Mr_Gnome>	GNU/Linux uses OpenGL ;)
Jul 20 17:33:07 <itidus21>	not to mention the varying approaches app coders take towards screen tearing
Jul 20 17:34:22 <itidus21>	so i get happy just to see a 2d app run at a high frame rate with no tearing
Jul 20 17:34:49 <itidus21>	cos i know so much can go wrong
Jul 20 17:35:00 <--	coolty has quit (Client exited)

Jul 20 18:35:52 <MPQC>	What's the point of everyone joining here if they never talk
Jul 20 18:35:54 <MPQC>	I don't get it
Jul 20 18:36:30 <traeak>	we just pretty much
Jul 20 18:36:34 <traeak>	lurk
Jul 20 18:36:39 <MPQC>	Damn lurkers
Jul 20 18:36:46 <traeak>	the nD probably isn't realistic anyways
Jul 20 18:36:58 <MPQC>	But my firmware ._.
Jul 20 18:37:05 <MPQC>	It's real :|
Jul 20 18:37:07 <traeak>	but it seems to be spawning off other efforts that are realistic
Jul 20 18:37:17 <traeak>	ahh
Jul 20 18:37:22 <traeak>	what cpu is it for ?
Jul 20 18:37:32 <MPQC>	MIPS
Jul 20 18:37:40 <traeak>	ingenic ?
Jul 20 18:37:43 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 20 18:37:50 <MPQC>	Perhaps
Jul 20 18:37:59 <traeak>	jz4725b or something ?
Jul 20 18:38:10 <MPQC>	Dunno
Jul 20 18:38:10 <traeak>	perhaps jz4755 which is reasonable
Jul 20 18:38:36 <MPQC>	One sec
Jul 20 18:39:02 <MPQC>	(2)
Jul 20 18:39:06 <MPQC>	(3)
Jul 20 18:39:35 <traeak>	jz4725b apparently is not in manufacture anymore
Jul 20 18:39:42 <traeak>	so that's a bad cpu to base a machine on
Jul 20 18:40:34 <EveningNewbs>	Haha
Jul 20 18:40:41 <EveningNewbs>	Unless you have a time machine.
Jul 20 18:41:05 <MPQC>	Time = Money
Jul 20 18:41:08 <MPQC>	ATM = Time Machine
Jul 20 18:41:12 <MPQC>	Your argument is invalid
Jul 20 18:41:32 <EveningNewbs>	Only if you remember your PIN.
Jul 20 18:41:55 <MPQC>	True
Jul 20 18:43:05 <traeak>	so that was your firmware running in the video ?
Jul 20 18:43:37 <MPQC>	Perhaps
Jul 20 18:44:14 <traeak>	and that's a big part of the nD problem
Jul 20 18:44:21 <traeak>	no openness about what's going on or plans
Jul 20 18:44:35 <traeak>	and it's way too easy to call bullshit on bob since he doesn't exactly have a history of stability
Jul 20 18:44:44 <MPQC>	The open handheld that isn't open ^_^
Jul 20 18:44:55 <MPQC>	My firmware is real, and I can even release the code for it
Jul 20 18:45:27 <traeak>	doesn't make sense for it to be a full blown OS
Jul 20 18:45:29 <MPQC>	Only a few files
Jul 20 18:45:31 <traeak>	that's not necessary
Jul 20 18:45:34 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 20 18:45:57 <traeak>	i always wonder why some guys want handheld gaming systems to be min computers
Jul 20 18:46:03 <traeak>	and thye just need to do handheld gaming well
Jul 20 18:46:07 <MPQC>	That's what the pandora's for
Jul 20 18:46:20 <MPQC>	Or any netbook for that matter
Jul 20 18:46:54 <traeak>	and netbooks can easily be had for $199 nowadays
Jul 20 18:48:00 <MPQC>	It'd odd to think that the nD is apparently the size of a micro
Jul 20 18:48:19 <MPQC>	Every time I imagine it I see it as easily the size of a PSP lol
Jul 20 18:51:32 <MPQC>	It's made for kids after all :|
Jul 20 18:52:07 <traeak>	yup, micro makes the most sense
Jul 20 18:52:09 <itidus21>	im only a newbie here, anyway a comment i have which needed to be disclaimed
Jul 20 18:52:13 <--	Languid has quit (Client exited)
Jul 20 18:52:41 <traeak>	if this can be made to work i'm all for it
Jul 20 18:52:53 <traeak>	just the up front costs of getting plastics done
Jul 20 18:52:56 <traeak>	that killt the pandora
Jul 20 18:52:57 <traeak>	and then
Jul 20 18:52:58 <itidus21>	the reality is that stability isn't possible in the real world.
Jul 20 18:53:14 <traeak>	finding a factory that will manufacture the pcbs and plastics without taking a profit themselves
Jul 20 18:53:16 <itidus21>	its more like Bob knows his goal, and he's just finding the way there
Jul 20 18:53:33 <itidus21>	but he can't say he is there until he is there
Jul 20 18:53:39 <traeak>	of course if bob can innovate the current traditional manufacturing process
Jul 20 18:53:41 <traeak>	more power to him
Jul 20 18:54:34 <itidus21>	he needs cooperation from all the suppliers and investors so it's a bit of a waiting game.. and a hoping game
Jul 20 18:54:51 <itidus21>	im just imagining this much
Jul 20 18:55:19 <itidus21>	that if he is focused on it.... theres really no rabbit in the hat except the goals he dreams up
Jul 20 18:55:51 <itidus21>	basically he can't make it happen on demand.
Jul 20 18:55:59 <itidus21>	it's all cooperative stuff
Jul 20 18:56:23 <itidus21>	any deadlines would be artificial in that sense
Jul 20 18:56:25 <MPQC>	I'm going to ping you
Jul 20 18:56:28 <traeak>	hehe
Jul 20 18:56:38 <traeak>	if you understand how business works
Jul 20 18:56:49 <traeak>	getting "cooperation" is very difficult unless all parties are movitivate
Jul 20 18:56:50 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 20 18:56:53 <traeak>	the more parties the worse it is

Jul 20 19:10:06 <Exophase>	So now Bob banned Craigix for posting his pricing projection..
Jul 20 19:10:12 <Exophase>	And removed the post of course.
Jul 20 19:10:16 <Exophase>	That's at least the second time.
Jul 20 19:10:19 <MPQC>	I`m banned for posting my firmware ._.
Jul 20 19:10:25 <MPQC>	Damn competition
Jul 20 19:10:34 <Exophase>	I hope you guys aren't bothered by someone like this.
Jul 20 19:10:46 <traeak>	not surprised, craigx isn't an idiot
Jul 20 19:10:50 <traeak>	what was his pricing projection anyways?
Jul 20 19:11:03 <Exophase>	Exaggerated, but still
Jul 20 19:11:10 <MPQC>	ScreenshotÉ
Jul 20 19:11:15 <MPQC>	Ah damn you french keyboard
Jul 20 19:11:20 <Exophase>	http://boards.openpandora.org/index.php?/topic/3959-the-nd/page__st__60
Jul 20 19:11:20 <MPQC>	Screenshot?*
Jul 20 19:11:22 <traeak>	well, always take a number with a grain of salt
Jul 20 19:11:42 <traeak>	craigx will be good to a factor of 2x
Jul 20 19:11:45 <traeak>	2x or .5x
Jul 20 19:13:01 <MPQC>	He didn't even list the buttons as their own
Jul 20 19:13:08 <MPQC>	A disgrace
Jul 20 19:13:12 <Exophase>	I just think deleting threads and banning people after their first post calling them "trolls" is not a good precedent
Jul 20 19:13:27 <Exophase>	Makes me wonder what kind of tyrannical control he'll exercise over the app store.
Jul 20 19:13:45 <Exophase>	I'm actually surprised he hasn't banned me yet.
Jul 20 19:14:47 <MPQC>	gBev: Please unban me? ^_^
Jul 20 19:15:02 <gBev>	why were you banned?
Jul 20 19:15:08 <MPQC>	Because I posted my firmware
Jul 20 19:15:22 <gBev>	?
Jul 20 19:15:25 <MPQC>	It even came with a video for proof
Jul 20 19:15:27 <traeak>	bu still assuming craigx is off by a factor of 2x
Jul 20 19:15:38 <traeak>	that still means ~$30 to put this all together
Jul 20 19:15:56 <Exophase>	He posted a video of software running on something or other that looked like the nD firmware but with bigger text (??)
Jul 20 19:16:01 <Exophase>	And made some joke about camera quality.
Jul 20 19:16:04 <Exophase>	Banned on sight.
Jul 20 19:16:10 <Exophase>	With Bob saying it was "funny"
Jul 20 19:16:15 <Exophase>	And thread removed, of course
Jul 20 19:16:17 <MPQC>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6KR4twT_Rs
Jul 20 19:16:25 <MPQC>	Don't comment on my music taste
Jul 20 19:16:36 <Exophase>	traeak; Yeah everyone who knows anything about pricing knows $10 is totally unrealistic and $20 is only a little better.
Jul 20 19:17:25 <MPQC>	Well dealextreme's cheapest console is $8
Jul 20 19:17:31 <MPQC>	http://www.dealextreme.com/p/3-3-lcd-handheld-8-bit-football-game-player-2-x-aa-81932
Jul 20 19:17:35 <MPQC>	Then again look what you buy LOL
Jul 20 19:17:35 <Exophase>	That's nothing like nD though.
Jul 20 19:17:51 <MPQC>	It has buttons
Jul 20 19:17:53 <Exophase>	Plus you have no idea what real costs went into that, it could be inventory dumping.
Jul 20 19:18:20 <Exophase>	Anyway calling that a console, seriously?
Jul 20 19:18:35 <MPQC>	http://www.dealextreme.com/p/nj-pocket-2-5-tft-lcd-portable-game-console-with-tv-out-and-built-in-games-3-x-aaa-65514
Jul 20 19:18:36 <MPQC>	Next is that
Jul 20 19:18:40 <MPQC>	Probably just a NES emulator
Jul 20 19:18:55 <MPQC>	That's what it looks like to me anyways
Jul 20 19:18:58 <MPQC>	$17
Jul 20 19:18:58 <traeak>	http://www.dealextreme.com/p/nj-pocket-2-5-tft-lcd-portable-game-console-with-tv-out-and-built-in-games-3-x-aaa-65514
Jul 20 19:19:06 <Exophase>	Yeah we've all seen it.
Jul 20 19:19:06 <traeak>	oof sry
Jul 20 19:19:06 <MPQC>	I totally ninja'd you
Jul 20 19:19:19 <Exophase>	And if you think that shows you can do nD for $20 you're as naive as Bob, no offense.
Jul 20 19:19:41 <MPQC>	lol
Jul 20 19:20:12 <MPQC>	Of course it doesn't show anything
Jul 20 19:20:17 <traeak>	for $17 that *is* a huge hunk of junk
Jul 20 19:20:48 <Exophase>	But it's exactly what Bob has been doing.
Jul 20 19:20:59 <Exophase>	Linking these things and going zomg they must be like 300% marked up!
Jul 20 19:21:05 <Exophase>	Think of what we can do for $10 with no mark up!
Jul 20 19:21:10 <MPQC>	The A380 is still the sexiest console out there
Jul 20 19:21:11 <Exophase>	We'll make huge profits on our first party games!
Jul 20 19:21:28 <Exophase>	nD is only a stone's throw from A320 spec-wise
Jul 20 19:21:29 <Exophase>	If even that.
Jul 20 19:21:34 <Exophase>	And A320 costs like $60+
Jul 20 19:21:45 <MPQC>	Cheapest I've seen was $78
Jul 20 19:21:50 <Exophase>	There you go then.
Jul 20 19:21:56 <traeak>	would be interesting to know the manuf costs on the 320
Jul 20 19:22:05 <Exophase>	Also, when you look at Chinese prices.
Jul 20 19:22:09 <Exophase>	Always look out for the S&H costs.
Jul 20 19:22:15 <Exophase>	Because often they'll pad the real price into that.
Jul 20 19:22:33 <MPQC>	Dealextreme doesn't thoug
Jul 20 19:22:35 <Exophase>	traeak; Would guess it's like $30-40
Jul 20 19:22:45 <traeak>	my thoughts too
Jul 20 19:23:45 <Exophase>	And its SoC is bottom of the barrel price-wise, LCD, RAM, NAND are nD level
Jul 20 19:23:57 <Exophase>	No wifi..
Jul 20 19:24:06 <Exophase>	And he seriously thinks he can get wifi for like $1?
Jul 20 19:24:37 <MPQC>	lol
Jul 20 19:25:20 <MPQC>	Wonder if I'm unbanned
Jul 20 19:25:44 <MPQC>	Yeah still banned ._.
Jul 20 19:27:33 <Exophase>	Don't expect to be any time soon if ever..
Jul 20 19:28:07 <MPQC>	Well it's definitely not hard to just make a new account lol
Jul 20 19:28:20 <MPQC>	But I spent a whole hour on that firmware just to be banned for it :(
Jul 20 19:29:03 <Exophase>	Yeah he strikes me as an act first, think later sort of guy :/
Jul 20 19:30:12 <traeak>	yup

Jul 20 19:48:18 <itidus21>	the way I see it, the main trouble will not be getting the price low, but to stop the investors raising the price
Jul 20 19:49:51 <MPQC>	You ca
Jul 20 19:50:19 <MPQC>	Well you can just pretend to see invisible text and finish my sentence
Jul 20 19:50:29 <itidus21>	cool
Jul 20 19:50:39 <Exophase>	itidus21; The way I see it the main trouble will be getting investors.
Jul 20 19:50:43 <MPQC>	Was deleting it and my cat ran across my keyboard lo
Jul 20 19:51:00 <MPQC>	Exophase: I'm totally investing in a device that he refuses to show

Jul 21 04:37:38 <itidus21>	well what about if you wanted to make a gameboy-1 clone?
Jul 21 04:37:56 <itidus21>	like.. just a clone of the gameboy more or less
Jul 21 04:38:06 <itidus21>	not to emulate the gameboy
Jul 21 04:41:03 <itidus21>	that would be a good fallback plan if things don't work out
Jul 21 04:41:50 <[]J>	don't think people would want to play that :1
Jul 21 04:42:49 <itidus21>	well, Bob knows what he's doing
Jul 21 04:45:37 <itidus21>	I am sold on his points that these things are made cheap and sold expensive
Jul 21 04:45:46 <itidus21>	and that prices for technology are falling every day
Jul 21 04:46:25 <itidus21>	and also, the factor that the more they make the cheaper each one can be
Jul 21 04:51:28 <itidus21>	I think I would buy a device sold at cost if it had 160x100x2bits, dpad + 2 buttons and some kind of transferral mechanism between pc and device
Jul 21 04:52:01 <itidus21>	^160x120
Jul 21 04:52:27 <itidus21>	and a cheap speaker
Jul 21 04:52:31 <itidus21>	no headphone plug
Jul 21 04:54:01 <itidus21>	but im weird
Jul 21 04:56:03 <itidus21>	maybe i wouldn't.. it's just that theres a certain appeal to programming under constraints
Jul 21 05:05:38 <[]J>	creativity is all about working under constraints
Jul 21 05:05:46 <[]J>	if there aren't constraints it's just random nonsense

Jul 21 08:25:01 <feep>	hi
Jul 21 08:25:21 <feep>	I'm having an argument with someone else elsewhere about whether the $10-$20 point is feasible
Jul 21 08:25:32 <feep>	is there a list of proposed components anywhere?
Jul 21 08:25:43 <feep>	also I'm curious which component ends up factoring into the price the most.
Jul 21 08:25:45 -->	tiffany (~kawaii@synIRC-BAE01003.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) has joined #nD
Jul 21 08:26:28 <Kutagh>	feep, nope.
Jul 21 08:26:32 <feep>	Darn.
Jul 21 08:26:43 <feep>	Kutagh: well do you think the estimate is realistic?
Jul 21 08:26:45 <Kutagh>	bob said what he is aiming for though
Jul 21 08:26:52 <Kutagh>	a 400MHz ARM soc
Jul 21 08:26:55 <Kutagh>	32MB RAM
Jul 21 08:27:10 <feep>	yeah I saw that
Jul 21 08:27:12 <Kutagh>	and a LCD screen at 320x240
Jul 21 08:27:16 <Kutagh>	thats all we know
Jul 21 08:27:20 <Kutagh>	and as to whether it is realistic...
Jul 21 08:27:35 <Kutagh>	it has the chance to be realistic assuming you can get a large enough userbase to create big batches
Jul 21 08:27:37 <feep>	I mean I'm not sure whether the arm soc would factor more, or the 2G internal storage
Jul 21 08:27:46 <feep>	not sure how much 2G goes for these days.
Jul 21 08:28:13 <feep>	actually, the most expensive part would probably be the battery
Jul 21 08:28:24 <Kutagh>	USB sticks of 2GB (which the internal flash storage basically is) is sold retail for less than $5 I think
Jul 21 08:28:35 <Kutagh>	so bulk? might be able to get it down to $1~$2
Jul 21 08:28:50 <Kutagh>	maybe even below $1
Jul 21 08:28:58 <feep>	okay, that's less than I thought
Jul 21 08:29:01 <Kutagh>	as you dont need the packaging, only the memory chips
Jul 21 08:29:04 <feep>	yea
Jul 21 08:29:15 <feep>	say $5-$8 for the soc, realistic?
Jul 21 08:29:29 <feep>	looking up lcd prices..
Jul 21 08:29:49 <Kutagh>	I think it is the actual licensing stuff and the moulding that makes it expensive
Jul 21 08:30:06 <feep>	well yeah, licensing is how arm gets paid :p
Jul 21 08:30:12 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 21 08:30:48 <Kutagh>	newegg has several  USB sticks of 2BG at 6 dollar
Jul 21 08:30:53 <Kutagh>	including shipping
Jul 21 08:31:08 <Kutagh>	gonna take a guess at 1 dollar shipping, total of 100% markup
Jul 21 08:31:13 <feep>	man it's surprisingly hard to find a separate 320x240 display
Jul 21 08:31:14 <Kutagh>	then cost price would be $2.50
Jul 21 08:31:28 <tiffany>	I've never found one, honestly
Jul 21 08:31:29 <Kutagh>	feep, you gotta look for 240x320 instead
Jul 21 08:31:30 <Kutagh>	;)
Jul 21 08:31:32 <feep>	oooooh
Jul 21 08:31:33 <tiffany>	I suck at google
Jul 21 08:31:38 <feep>	that's bizarre
Jul 21 08:31:42 <Kutagh>	nah
Jul 21 08:31:45 <feep>	every resolution I've ever seen has been wxh.
Jul 21 08:31:47 <Kutagh>	smartphone hardware
Jul 21 08:31:51 <feep>	... oh.
Jul 21 08:31:56 <Kutagh>	;)
Jul 21 08:32:04 <feep>	^^
Jul 21 08:32:04 <Kutagh>	smartphone hardware is mass-produced
Jul 21 08:32:16 <Kutagh>	so they tend to be cheaper than specialized solutions
Jul 21 08:32:44 <feep>	google shopping starts at $10 but I think that's an indexing fail
Jul 21 08:33:10 <feep>	Kutagh: I wish there was such a thing as a cheap external usb-driven display I could put on my pc and use to display load stats
Jul 21 08:33:19 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 21 08:33:29 <feep>	everybody loves pretty graphs :D
Jul 21 08:33:34 <Kutagh>	you should look into a cheap VGA one instead :p
Jul 21 08:33:42 <feep>	yeah but my vga port is already in use
Jul 21 08:33:46 <itidus21>	kutagh: well clearly he wants it to play Bob's game..
Jul 21 08:33:46 <Kutagh>	:X
Jul 21 08:33:50 <itidus21>	however.. 
Jul 21 08:33:54 <feep>	and anyways multi-head Xorg sucks ass.
Jul 21 08:34:06 <itidus21>	nintendo used to adapt their hardware to mario games also
Jul 21 08:34:09 <Kutagh>	DVI/HDMI tends to have licensing costs as well
Jul 21 08:34:20 <Kutagh>	so VGA would be the cheapest solution ;)
Jul 21 08:34:31 <Kutagh>	btw feep 
Jul 21 08:34:31 <feep>	um that note was unrelated to nD :p
Jul 21 08:34:43 <Kutagh>	you got a DVI or HDMI exit free?
Jul 21 08:34:58 <Kutagh>	cuz you could likely find a DVI->VGA adapter and use that :p
Jul 21 08:35:01 <feep>	good point, I could use that
Jul 21 08:35:07 <feep>	still, usb would be more fun
Jul 21 08:35:13 <feep>	getting to write my own handler for it~
Jul 21 08:35:14 <itidus21>	I have a component to hdmi adaptor
Jul 21 08:35:47 <Kutagh>	feep, yeah but USB has licensing costs as well and lower bandwidth rates
Jul 21 08:36:08 <feep>	no you misunderstand
Jul 21 08:36:24 <feep>	I just want it as a one-off thing
Jul 21 08:36:25 <Kutagh>	I know bandwidth wouldn't be that much of an issue
Jul 21 08:36:28 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 21 08:36:37 <Kutagh>	http://www.crystalfontz.com/
Jul 21 08:36:43 <Kutagh>	wouldnt that be something for u? :p
Jul 21 08:36:47 <feep>	looking
Jul 21 08:37:03 <feep>	Color me intrigued!
Jul 21 08:37:08 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 21 08:37:47 <itidus21>	i had this idea for a screen once: 8x4x1bit
Jul 21 08:37:55 <Kutagh>	xD
Jul 21 08:38:02 <feep>	well it's a bit low-res
Jul 21 08:38:05 <itidus21>	the idea being that you could store the entire video memory in 32bits
Jul 21 08:38:23 <itidus21>	nowadays 64bits would mean uhh
Jul 21 08:38:24 <itidus21>	hmm
Jul 21 08:39:12 <itidus21>	8x8 or 16x4
Jul 21 08:39:39 <feep>	Quantity 	Price
Jul 21 08:39:40 <feep>	1 	$422.68
Jul 21 08:39:41 <feep>	wtf
Jul 21 08:39:51 <itidus21>	or 10x6x1
Jul 21 08:39:52 <feep>	oh it's a full computer
Jul 21 08:39:53 <feep>	right
Jul 21 08:39:57 <Kutagh>	lol
Jul 21 08:39:57 <itidus21>	if you left off the extra
Jul 21 08:40:32 <feep>	it's all like "20x4 characters, 20x4 characters, 800x600"
Jul 21 08:40:42 <feep>	"oh you like that? WELL IT COSTS LIKE $ 400 SO FUCK YOU"
Jul 21 08:41:13 <Kutagh>	feep: http://www.crystalfontz.com/product/CFAF128160C-018T this is the screen only :p
Jul 21 08:41:43 <feep>	pretty~
Jul 21 08:41:54 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 21 08:42:02 <Kutagh>	now you gotta have some EE knowledge
Jul 21 08:42:07 <feep>	yeah
Jul 21 08:42:09 <feep>	0.
Jul 21 08:42:13 <Kutagh>	but I think ya might be able to convert it from parrarel to USB
Jul 21 08:42:13 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 21 08:42:26 <feep>	EE? more like AA.
Jul 21 08:42:37 <Kutagh>	electrical engineering ;)
Jul 21 08:42:39 <feep>	as in "AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!! "
Jul 21 08:42:42 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 21 08:42:52 *	feep shakes
Jul 21 08:42:56 <Kutagh>	I think there would be enough tutorials on the web though
Jul 21 08:42:59 <feep>	keep that messy stuff away from me plzkthx
Jul 21 08:43:02 <Kutagh>	but got to have the tools though :p
Jul 21 08:43:11 *	feep is coder plzkthx
Jul 21 08:43:50 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 21 08:43:55 <Kutagh>	so am I...
Jul 21 08:44:03 <Kutagh>	but it doesnt hurt to have a wider knowledge base :p
Jul 21 08:44:26 <feep>	well it does hurt when you stick a soldering iron through your typing hand
Jul 21 08:44:30 <feep>	theoretically speaking
Jul 21 08:44:43 <feep>	:p
Jul 21 08:44:51 <tiffany>	._.
Jul 21 08:45:26 <Kutagh>	then you gotta learn not to do it.

Jul 21 08:51:36 <Kutagh>	wb emusan 
Jul 21 08:54:51 <feep>	Kutagh: how do you actually google a tutorial for that?
Jul 21 08:55:19 <Kutagh>	feep, google fu
Jul 21 08:55:20 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 21 08:55:37 <feep>	google fu fail.
Jul 21 08:55:55 <emusan>	tutorial for?
Jul 21 08:56:07 <feep>	emusan: wiring http://www.crystalfontz.com/product/CFAF128160C-018T up to usb
Jul 21 08:56:19 <feep>	for a person almost-completely new to EE
Jul 21 08:56:36 <emusan>	thats not going to be easy....
Jul 21 08:56:40 <feep>	I'm aware. :p
Jul 21 08:56:45 <emusan>	I don't think there would be a tutorial out there...
Jul 21 08:56:53 <emusan>	unless you know someone has already done it
Jul 21 08:57:04 <feep>	[14:33:23] <feep> Kutagh: I wish there was such a thing as a cheap external usb-driven display I could put on my pc and use to display load stats
Jul 21 08:57:21 <emusan>	you wouldn't want to use that...
Jul 21 08:57:25 <emusan>	there are pre-made ones
Jul 21 08:57:37 <feep>	I haven't been able to find any that are both affordable and not shit.
Jul 21 08:57:40 <emusan>	plus kutagh has two 24" screens..
Jul 21 08:57:42 <emusan>	isn't that enough
Jul 21 08:57:58 <feep>	I don't need another screen. Screens draw power and are large.
Jul 21 08:58:10 <feep>	I just want a little separate software-driven display (for load stats)
Jul 21 08:58:38 <feep>	so I can see at a glance when my program is leakbombing :p
Jul 21 08:58:42 <emusan>	oh, sorry, I read that as kutagh saying he needed another display...
Jul 21 08:58:55 <emusan>	feep, you would need to connect this display to a microcontroller of some sort with some kind of USB support and then write a custom driver...
Jul 21 08:59:03 <feep>	the driver part isn't a problem
Jul 21 08:59:11 *	feep only sucks at hardware. :P
Jul 21 08:59:35 <emusan>	are you sure?
Jul 21 08:59:39 <feep>	but yeah if there was an affordable retail solution I'd use that
Jul 21 08:59:45 <feep>	nah not even close to sure
Jul 21 08:59:46 <emusan>	you can write a USB display driver?
Jul 21 08:59:48 <feep>	but sure enough to give it a try. :D
Jul 21 09:00:00 <emusan>	okay...
Jul 21 09:00:07 <emusan>	well the hardware part is also difficult...
Jul 21 09:00:11 <feep>	:(
Jul 21 09:00:48 <emusan>	how attached are you to that display?
Jul 21 09:00:56 <feep>	not very.
Jul 21 09:01:00 <feep>	it's just an idle idea.
Jul 21 09:01:49 <emusan>	no I mean that specific LCD...
Jul 21 09:01:50 <feep>	oh
Jul 21 09:01:52 <feep>	not.
Jul 21 09:02:18 <emusan>	or resolution...
Jul 21 09:02:23 <feep>	also not
Jul 21 09:02:26 <feep>	as long as it isn't like
Jul 21 09:02:31 <feep>	2x20 ascii, lol
Jul 21 09:02:34 <emusan>	lol
Jul 21 09:02:44 <feep>	those are actually sold!!
Jul 21 09:02:45 <feep>	>_<

Jul 21 09:03:49 <emusan>	^thats sorta what you want
Jul 21 09:03:56 <emusan>	but it isn't full color or anything...
Jul 21 09:03:59 <feep>	http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/index-usb.html
Jul 21 09:04:33 <emusan>	you would be surprised...
Jul 21 09:04:37 <feep>	emusan: well it is neat and I'll keep it in mind but it's a bit small for what I need
Jul 21 09:04:41 <feep>	can't really render good graphs on that.
Jul 21 09:04:51 <emusan>	I wouldn't mind having one of those for a custom case...
Jul 21 09:04:57 <emusan>	you could do temps and such...
Jul 21 09:05:01 <emusan>	yeah, I understand...
Jul 21 09:05:22 <emusan>	how good are you at soldering?
Jul 21 09:05:28 <feep>	not.
Jul 21 09:05:30 <feep>	:D
Jul 21 09:06:43 <feep>	eh, I'mma keep this open for now and go do other, more happymaking things
Jul 21 09:06:45 <feep>	(minecraft)
Jul 21 09:06:55 <feep>	thanks for the pointers
Jul 21 09:07:12 <emusan>	uhh...
Jul 21 09:07:18 <emusan>	do you have a serial port?
Jul 21 09:07:22 <emusan>	or would it have to be USB?
Jul 21 09:07:25 <feep>	I don't actually know!
Jul 21 09:07:26 <feep>	hold on
Jul 21 09:07:32 <emusan>	and would you be okay with a USB->Serial in that case?
Jul 21 09:08:09 <feep>	I have ESATA XD
Jul 21 09:08:11 <feep>	no serial though
Jul 21 09:08:14 <feep>	sure, usb-serial is fine
Jul 21 09:08:41 <emusan>	http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8600
Jul 21 09:08:45 <emusan>	that might be what you want...
Jul 21 09:08:53 <emusan>	only 128x128 pixels though
Jul 21 09:08:56 <emusan>	but full color...
Jul 21 09:09:25 <feep>	nice!
Jul 21 09:09:43 <emusan>	I don't know how easy/hard it would be to communicate with it though...
Jul 21 09:10:03 <feep>	eh, that's not a problem
Jul 21 09:10:17 <emusan>	but it is the easiest way I can think of to do what you want...
Jul 21 09:10:23 <feep>	how do you actually connect that to anything?
Jul 21 09:10:25 <emusan>	without (much) soldering
Jul 21 09:10:38 <emusan>	uhh... those holes at the bottom are for soldering wires...

Jul 21 09:10:54 <feep>	aaah
Jul 21 09:10:58 <feep>	"break out"?
Jul 21 09:11:01 <emusan>	basically you'll connect it to a USB->serial converter of some sort...
Jul 21 09:11:13 <feep>	right
Jul 21 09:11:26 <emusan>	I could help you with that part if you wanted...
Jul 21 09:11:32 <feep>	nah that much I can manage :p
Jul 21 09:11:52 <feep>	might actually get two, put them side by side :D
Jul 21 09:11:59 <emusan>	get one first...
Jul 21 09:12:02 <emusan>	to make sure it will work
Jul 21 09:12:08 <feep>	true!
Jul 21 09:12:12 <feep>	emusan: thanks for the pointer
Jul 21 09:12:18 <feep>	I'll keep it open in a tab

Jul 22 14:49:51 <user82>	evening. i searched the forums and did not find any hint: will there be a gameboy(color) emulator for the nd?
Jul 22 14:51:40 <Kutagh>	None has been pledged yet.
Jul 22 14:51:47 <Kutagh>	anyway
Jul 22 14:52:01 <user82>	okay. but a console without hte legendary mario land isnt my console :D
Jul 22 14:52:03 <Kutagh>	the nD staff doesn't focus on the emulators
Jul 22 14:52:12 <Kutagh>	feel free to port an existing emulator though
Jul 22 14:52:25 <Kutagh>	GB/GBC should be quite viable to port, GBA might be harder but still viable afaik
Jul 22 14:52:36 <user82>	i would..but i didnt manage more than printing a few calculated prime numbers with the sdk..im not talented enough
Jul 22 14:52:56 <user82>	perhaps someone else does..i hope
Jul 22 14:53:02 <Kutagh>	protip for programming: You don't become great in a couple days.
Jul 22 14:53:08 <Kutagh>	Just keep working at it
Jul 22 14:53:18 <Kutagh>	and you'll get experience and become better
Jul 22 14:54:01 <user82>	yeah sure..but currently i think i dont have the time for a lot of time ;)
Jul 22 14:54:12 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 22 14:54:20 <Kutagh>	anyway
Jul 22 14:54:25 <user82>	but you could give me one more hint: is there a source for a complete game?
Jul 22 14:54:29 <Kutagh>	the nD likely won't be out for several months
Jul 22 14:54:34 <user82>	to watch and learn besides the sample code
Jul 22 14:54:53 <Kutagh>	nD games or C++ games in general?
Jul 22 14:55:16 <Kutagh>	afaik on the forums someone posted solitaire or something like that
Jul 22 14:55:20 <Kutagh>	(nD forums)
Jul 22 14:55:22 <user82>	nd games
Jul 22 14:55:30 <user82>	okay..ill look
Jul 22 14:55:31 <Kutagh>	so you could take a look at that
Jul 22 14:55:51 <Kutagh>	anyway, you shouldn't be focusing too much on the nD just yet in terms of programming
Jul 22 14:56:07 <Kutagh>	start with PC games, more freedom
Jul 22 14:56:13 <Kutagh>	using C++ with SDL
Jul 22 14:56:41 <Kutagh>	the main differences would be the screen size, processing speed and memory space
Jul 22 14:57:25 <user82>	so the sdl environment takes care of porting to the nd more or less (as long as i watch the limits like screensize/memory)
Jul 22 14:57:26 <Kutagh>	so it is just different decisions to make, not really different way of coding
Jul 22 14:57:43 <user82>	seen it in the smaple..it was "just" c++ code
Jul 22 14:57:45 <Kutagh>	nah not really, but it'd make it quite easy to port
Jul 22 14:58:02 <Kutagh>	since basically the nD would be a custom Linux
Jul 22 14:58:17 <Kutagh>	with the SDL libraries installed
Jul 22 14:58:30 <user82>	hope the project is working out...i'd sure buy one or two nd's
Jul 22 14:58:50 <user82>	"123" is currently my favourite game ;)
Jul 22 14:58:54 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 22 14:59:00 <Kutagh>	anyway good luck! :)
Jul 22 14:59:31 <user82>	thanks.
Jul 22 14:59:41 <Kutagh>	time to continue working on my own projects (non-nD though, since C# won't be easily ported and I'm not in the mood of learning C++ while I'm not great with C# just yet :p)

Jul 22 15:53:09 <emusan>	the nD will be running Linux lol

Jul 22 16:07:36 <user82>	perhaps..should be easy enough to separate it
Jul 22 16:09:28 <beoran3>	to run linux, the CPU needs to be at least 32 bits. it won' t work on 8 or 16 bits cpu's. 
Jul 22 16:10:57 <emusan>	beoran we went over this...
Jul 22 16:11:01 <emusan>	its a 32bit cpu
Jul 22 16:11:03 <emusan>	lol
Jul 22 16:11:11 <emusan>	no one has ever said otherwise
Jul 22 16:11:12 <emusan>	its ARM
Jul 22 16:11:14 <emusan>	it has to be
Jul 22 16:11:55 <emusan>	I wasn't able to type it all out when we first talked, but I figured /someone/ would mention it...
Jul 22 16:12:23 <user82>	32bit isnt that more expensive..but that more powerful ^^
Jul 22 16:12:43 <emusan>	32bit isn't really an expense thing...
Jul 22 16:12:51 <user82>	still given the 5$ that can go to the cpu..its quite amazing what you get those days
Jul 22 16:12:56 <emusan>	the fact he seems to be going with arm means it /has/ to be 32bit
Jul 22 16:14:01 <user82>	its not yet set the cpu. or is it?
Jul 22 16:15:29 <beoran3>	emusan: sure I know but i though it beared mentioning here

Jul 22 20:10:12 <Stryker001>	hey, random hardware question: if we could get low-level enough, could we use the Wi-Fi hardware for BT?
Jul 22 20:11:47 <Stryker001>	(In theory?)
Jul 22 20:18:02 <Kutagh>	err
Jul 22 20:18:23 <Kutagh>	you mean as an ad-hoc device to device networking?
Jul 22 20:18:36 <Kutagh>	theoretical possibility
Jul 22 20:18:49 <Kutagh>	it depends on whether the device is only receiver or can also host
Jul 22 20:24:07 <emusan>	you can't do Bluetooth communication over wifi
Jul 22 20:24:11 <emusan>	different bandwidths
Jul 22 20:24:39 <emusan>	we will definately be able to do ad-hoc wifi though...
Jul 22 20:24:51 <emusan>	assuming we have wifi at all
Jul 22 20:25:03 <Kutagh>	heh
Jul 22 20:25:13 <Kutagh>	thats why I said, as an ad-hoc device to device networking
Jul 22 20:25:17 <Kutagh>	as that is basically what BT is
Jul 22 20:25:24 <emusan>	mhmm...
Jul 22 20:25:35 <emusan>	but I don't think they make chips that are just recievers
Jul 22 20:25:47 <emusan>	it mostly matters the software behind it...
Jul 22 20:32:49 <Kutagh>	emusan, yea
Jul 22 20:33:00 <Kutagh>	but still, firmware needs to support it
Jul 22 20:33:20 <Kutagh>	otherwise you get compatibility issues with modified firmwares
Jul 22 20:33:57 <emusan>	yeah...
Jul 22 20:34:14 <emusan>	but it should be added officially...
Jul 22 20:34:25 <emusan>	and if not hopefully there will be a popular unofficial one
Jul 22 20:34:34 <emusan>	lol with an appstore that will pay dev's 100%
Jul 22 20:34:38 <emusan>	would be epic

Jul 23 14:45:32 <Exophase>	Bob admitted Bob's Game might not be ideal for his demographic.
Jul 23 14:45:50 <Exophase>	At the same time, I think Bob expects all kids to be like the hardcore child gamers that played NES
Jul 23 14:46:19 <Exophase>	I find it more surprising that he thinks kids will love 2D games in general.
Jul 23 14:46:19 <MPQC>	No, they all play COD and scream at you :P
Jul 23 14:46:28 <Exophase>	Especially ones like Bob's Game that aren't exactly the pinnacle of pixel art
Jul 23 14:47:27 <MPQC>	I thought it looks quite nice
Jul 23 14:47:40 <Exophase>	His backgrounds are okay, but his sprites all look the same.
Jul 23 14:47:53 <Exophase>	Not exactly the same of course, I'm just saying that all of the characters have the exact same pose.
Jul 23 14:48:40 <MPQC>	Hah
Jul 23 14:48:41 <Exophase>	Anyway, the thing with Bob's demographic statistics for say, DS, is that they're highly based on Japanese data.
Jul 23 14:48:53 <Exophase>	And in Japan demographics function very differently..
Jul 23 14:49:10 <Exophase>	Like, the content aimed at kids in manga is very different from what we think of as being child-aimed in America.
Jul 23 14:49:41 <Exophase>	And of course the chances that nD will take off in Japan are much slimmer than the chances that it'll take off in America and maybe Europe (which are already slim IMO)
Jul 23 14:50:05 <user82>	will bobs game be "hardcoded"?
Jul 23 14:50:20 <MPQC>	Meaning
Jul 23 14:50:44 <user82>	in the firmware..un-deleatable from the beginning
Jul 23 14:50:58 <Exophase>	MPQC; Look at all the sprites on the margins here http://www.bobsgame.com/
Jul 23 14:51:04 <Exophase>	And I think you'll see what I mean.
Jul 23 14:51:05 <MPQC>	Since he said you need to buy it, I'm guessing it won't be
Jul 23 14:51:39 <user82>	oh ok..didnt know that
Jul 23 14:51:41 <Exophase>	user82; He plans to pack it with the $20 nD initially
Jul 23 14:51:53 <Exophase>	I doubt there'll be anything you can't remove from the NAND
Jul 23 14:52:00 <Exophase>	God help you if you brick it.
Jul 23 14:52:02 <MPQC>	Hahaha, $20
Jul 23 14:52:10 <Exophase>	Hope it has USB boot.
Jul 23 14:52:34 <Exophase>	It's supposed to be $10 nD + $10 Bob's Game I guess. Actually since it's a packaged deal that implies he'll sell Bob's Game on its own for more than $10.
Jul 23 14:53:00 <Exophase>	Although, he probably won't sell nDs without Bob's Game for a good long while, so that might all be moot..
Jul 23 14:55:38 <user82>	10$ is little optimistic isnt it...
Jul 23 14:55:42 <user82>	for hardware
Jul 23 14:56:07 <user82>	well how long is bobs game anyway? i guess he invested a lot of time
Jul 23 14:58:32 <MPQC>	I betcha it's only as long as demo 2
Jul 23 15:01:09 <Exophase>	"optimistic" is an understatement
Jul 23 15:01:14 <Exophase>	Try "insane"
Jul 23 15:01:39 <Exophase>	There has been hints at a lot more content than demo 2, but it's hard to say, since the real content is the minigames and we haven't seen a lot of that.
Jul 23 15:02:34 <MPQC>	There has also been hints at a so called "nD"
Jul 23 15:02:40 <MPQC>	Which could also be short for "end"
Jul 23 15:02:51 <Exophase>	Nope, it's short for iNdie
Jul 23 15:03:21 <MPQC>	Because Bob says so?
Jul 23 15:03:28 <Exophase>	Uh, yeah?
Jul 23 15:03:30 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 23 15:03:38 <Exophase>	There's a lot of evidence that Bob's Game really did have a substantial amount of useful work put behind it, possibly even to near completion (if not completion)
Jul 23 15:03:38 <MPQC>	Bob also said he'll release a picture of it
Jul 23 15:03:41 <MPQC>	Hmmm.....................
Jul 23 15:03:47 <Exophase>	Did he?
Jul 23 15:03:51 <Exophase>	Where?
Jul 23 15:03:56 <MPQC>	You can't find it anymore
Jul 23 15:04:01 <Exophase>	He said he'd release a video of prototype hardware.
Jul 23 15:04:05 <Exophase>	Which he did.
Jul 23 15:04:10 <MPQC>	Yep
Jul 23 15:04:14 <Exophase>	nD is a concept, I think hardware-wise almost nothing has been done.
Jul 23 15:04:23 <MPQC>	So what's he playing on
Jul 23 15:04:26 <Exophase>	It's not an original concept either, it's just a dream.
Jul 23 15:04:46 <Exophase>	If I said I'm releasing a TV for $1 I wonder who all would eat it up.
Jul 23 15:05:21 <MPQC>	I would
Jul 23 15:05:30 <MPQC>	I believe anything everyone says

Jul 23 15:05:49 ---	ChanServ gives channel half-operator status to Giroro
Jul 23 15:05:53 <Exophase>	Bob always seems to overstate the novelty of his ideas and accomplishments if you ask me..
Jul 23 15:06:04 <Exophase>	Lots of "a game done by one person!" for Bob's Game, as if he's the only person to ever do that.
Jul 23 15:06:31 <Exophase>	"In response to my first video, some have wondered if it's really possible for one person to have made a retail length game..."
Jul 23 15:06:38 <MPQC>	What about ZUN
Jul 23 15:06:39 <MPQC>	lol
Jul 23 15:06:40 <Exophase>	Of course it's possible, because it has happened all the time. Even in the industry.
Jul 23 15:06:54 <MPQC>	One man developer, like 15 games now,
Jul 23 15:07:04 <Exophase>	Followed by "How can you prove you've done the 'impossible'"?
Jul 23 15:07:37 <Exophase>	I also appear to be the only person who think Bob has pretty bad musical sense
Jul 23 15:07:57 <MPQC>	:P

Jul 23 15:10:13 <MPQC>	lololl
Jul 23 15:10:20 <Exophase>	I broke my DS.
Jul 23 15:10:28 <Exophase>	Giroro; Oh is that right.
Jul 23 15:10:28 <MPQC>	Play it on an emulator
Jul 23 15:10:54 <Exophase>	Every stupid thing Bob says is just a troll! How could I have missed this?!
Jul 23 15:11:28 <Giroro>	I'm just saying, the ay you are posting right now, everything he has done is to get people to respond like that. 
Jul 23 15:11:40 <Exophase>	Bob's Game probably never existed at all lolzozlzoolz

Jul 23 15:12:03 <MPQC>	:)
Jul 23 15:12:11 <MPQC>	I could always just add Tetrid to it just to be cool like that
Jul 23 15:14:10 <Exophase>	Giroro; Okay?
Jul 23 15:14:19 <Exophase>	Who cares?
Jul 23 15:14:27 <Exophase>	Even if that's true, that is.
Jul 23 15:14:30 <MPQC>	<--------------
Jul 23 15:14:31 <Exophase>	Even if he deliberately wants to be criticized.
Jul 23 15:14:33 <Exophase>	For god knows why.
Jul 23 15:14:47 <Exophase>	Not that you really know. People assume way, way too much about trolling.
Jul 23 15:15:11 <Giroro>	I'm '"bob" knows very well that people talk a lot more about things they hate, and he publicly admits using this to his advantage.
Jul 23 15:15:11 <Giroro>	'
Jul 23 15:15:17 <Exophase>	And people are so paranoid about being trolled that they just think everything is a troll.
Jul 23 15:15:20 <Exophase>	And makes them look about as silly.
Jul 23 15:15:27 <Exophase>	As they would if they kept getting trolled.
Jul 23 15:15:31 <MPQC>	You quote nicely off his site
Jul 23 15:15:36 <Giroro>	See that in the FAQ, that is the keystone of his marketing
Jul 23 15:15:40 <MPQC>	Can I be op'd for quoting off his site?
Jul 23 15:15:46 <Exophase>	It's the keystone of his stupidity.
Jul 23 15:16:05 <MPQC>	I still hate "bob!"
Jul 23 15:16:09 <Giroro>	Weather or not it was a good idea to do that, he accomplished what he set out to do
Jul 23 15:16:13 <Exophase>	He calls Bob's Game's viral marketing a great success.. but based off of what? All of the sales of an unreleased game?
Jul 23 15:16:27 <Exophase>	Yeah it has gotten him a lot of attention. A lot of it negative. It's kind of common sense that negative attention isn't always a good thing.
Jul 23 15:16:27 <beoran3>	on the wide slpash it caused
Jul 23 15:16:42 <Exophase>	Giroro; He also said it after the fact.
Jul 23 15:16:44 <beoran3>	he might have wanted tha ttoo
Jul 23 15:16:48 <Exophase>	How much of what he says is really "just as planned"
Jul 23 15:16:56 <Exophase>	And not just pretending to be to save face?
Jul 23 15:17:07 <Giroro>	He was saying it at the time, just not publicly
Jul 23 15:17:30 <Exophase>	Anyway, I'm still not seeing the point.
Jul 23 15:17:38 <Exophase>	You were doing exactly what he wanted by criticizing him!
Jul 23 15:17:43 <Exophase>	Does that make the criticism invalid?
Jul 23 15:18:19 <Giroro>	probably not, but when someone hates something, they'll go into a chat and rant about it for 10 mins.
Jul 23 15:18:28 <Exophase>	I don't hate anything he does.
Jul 23 15:18:36 <Exophase>	Calling this "hate" is absurd
Jul 23 15:18:52 <Giroro>	well I'm speaking a little broadly
Jul 23 15:18:54 <beoran3>	I think the nd is a great idea that's unfortunately not posible yet
Jul 23 15:19:18 <beoran3>	you can make a 10-20$ handheld, but it will be a carppy 8 or 16 bits one. 
Jul 23 15:19:27 <Exophase>	beoran3; I think the criteria for deciding whether or not an idea is great or not hinges ENTIRELY on whether or not it's possible.
Jul 23 15:19:40 <Exophase>	Like if I said I was going to make my own nD for $5 instead would that be an even greater idea??
Jul 23 15:19:50 <beoran3>	Exophase: I disagree. Going to the mooos was always a great idea.
Jul 23 15:19:57 <beoran3>	going to the moon
Jul 23 15:20:08 <Exophase>	It's not a great idea, it's a desire.
Jul 23 15:20:10 <MPQC>	My Nd will be better then yours
Jul 23 15:20:13 <Exophase>	That people have had for a long time.
Jul 23 15:20:22 <Exophase>	A great idea involves something people haven't realized.
Jul 23 15:20:49 <beoran3>	Exophase: again, not always. 
Jul 23 15:21:32 <Exophase>	Well obviously I disagree..
Jul 23 15:21:40 <beoran3>	a cheap handheld idea lfor homebre. That's a great idea. 
Jul 23 15:21:53 <beoran3>	so far that's never been made. 
Jul 23 15:22:00 <MPQC>	I wonder why
Jul 23 15:22:03 <MPQC>	lolo
Jul 23 15:22:07 <beoran3>	either the handheld was cheap but useless for homebrew
Jul 23 15:22:11 <Exophase>	*cough*Dingoo*cough*
Jul 23 15:22:16 <beoran3>	or , like the pandora, expensive.
Jul 23 15:22:17 <MPQC>	My dingoo is sexy
Jul 23 15:22:25 <MPQC>	Nobody can deny, that thing is sexy
Jul 23 15:22:26 <Exophase>	Do you think that's a worse idea because it's not $10?
Jul 23 15:22:33 <beoran3>	Dingoo wan't designed for homebred, it was hacked. 
Jul 23 15:22:50 <Exophase>	"hacked" implies they were fighting against it.
Jul 23 15:22:55 <beoran3>	only when the makers realised that homebrew was hot they started to help booboo
Jul 23 15:23:02 <Exophase>	The means aren't important.. the important thing is that it was embraced pretty quickly by the retailers
Jul 23 15:23:10 <Exophase>	So?
Jul 23 15:23:14 <beoran3>	well,let me say it differently: it was not intended nor designed fro homebrew
Jul 23 15:23:17 <Exophase>	What difference does that make to the end user?
Jul 23 15:23:41 <beoran3>	I'm talking to the dfferece it make to me, which is a lot. :)
Jul 23 15:23:49 <Exophase>	Anyway your examples are pretty extreme.
Jul 23 15:24:01 <Exophase>	If you want to list things that were meant for homebrew go back to GP32
Jul 23 15:24:09 <Exophase>	And its successors, much cheaper than Pandora.
Jul 23 15:24:22 <beoran3>	Exophase: hmmm... that's a ppoint though
Jul 23 15:25:01 <Exophase>	These were sold at profit, but that's because they have to be.
Jul 23 15:25:18 <Exophase>	nD won't work at cost.
Jul 23 15:25:21 <Exophase>	Still, it reminds me a lot of this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watara_Supervision
Jul 23 15:26:10 <Exophase>	I imagine if Supervision were done in the internet age they would have gone with digital distribution because it's a lot cheaper and less risky.
Jul 23 15:26:14 <Exophase>	These aren't "good ideas", this is common sense.
Jul 23 15:26:38 <beoran3>	Exophase: common sense is exeeningly uncommon now, though, I feel. :p
Jul 23 15:26:54 <Exophase>	That's false by definition/.

Jul 23 21:56:24 <emusan>	epic
Jul 23 21:56:27 <emusan>	lol
Jul 23 21:57:44 <emusan>	I guess that says something about how "open" this will be...
Jul 23 21:58:23 <MPQC>	Well ban will be over soon I think
Jul 23 21:58:29 <MPQC>	It was a week ban and I forget when I was banned...
Jul 23 21:58:44 <MPQC>	Let's see
Jul 23 21:58:59 <MPQC>	26th
Jul 23 21:59:03 <MPQC>	I shall be unbanned
Jul 23 21:59:38 <emusan>	ah
Jul 23 21:59:57 <emusan>	was the firmware thing a joke?
Jul 23 22:00:03 <MPQC>	It's awesome :|

Jul 23 22:03:55 <MPQC>	Maybe I'll make it less similar to his, use something like a PSP styled one
Jul 23 22:04:01 <MPQC>	XMB
Jul 23 22:04:45 <emusan>	whats it recorded on?
Jul 23 22:05:01 <emusan>	dingoo?
Jul 23 22:05:01 <MPQC>	Cellphone camera
Jul 23 22:05:22 <MPQC>	That's for me to know and for you to find out
Jul 23 22:05:24 <MPQC>	But the dingoo is sexy
Jul 23 22:05:42 <MPQC>	Dingoo has 2 layered screen, so it can't be a dingoo
Jul 23 22:05:45 <MPQC>	Nice attempt though

Jul 23 22:06:00 <MPQC>	Hah damn lagger :P
Jul 23 22:07:35 <MPQC>	Why doesn't bob ever come in here
Jul 23 22:07:50 <MPQC>	He's online now, don't tell me he doesn't know how to use IRC
Jul 23 22:10:10 <Triverske>	He thinks of us as inferior
Jul 23 22:10:18 <MPQC>	But if I was to do an XMB, I'd need some graphics and I can't draw worth shit...
Jul 23 22:10:23 <MPQC>	Stupid icons lol
Jul 23 22:10:43 <MPQC>	Who here can make me some icons :P
Jul 23 22:12:35 <MPQC>	Some 32x32 would probably be fantastic....
Jul 23 22:13:41 <Triverske>	I can do
Jul 23 22:14:19 <Triverske>	maybe
Jul 23 22:14:25 <Triverske>	I'll think about it
Jul 23 22:14:38 <MPQC>	:|
Jul 23 22:14:50 <MPQC>	I'll worth with 32x32 red squares till then
Jul 23 22:15:13 <MPQC>	They would be magenta but I use that for transparent
Jul 23 22:15:17 <MPQC>	Because nothing beats pink
Jul 23 22:15:40 <itidus22>	pink vs pink
Jul 23 22:15:48 <itidus22>	en garde!
Jul 23 22:16:25 <itidus22>	sorry--
Jul 23 22:16:28 <MPQC>	lol
Jul 23 22:16:39 <MPQC>	Must plan how I'm going to do it :P

Jul 23 22:18:14 <Exophase>	Stole focus on me while I was typing
Jul 23 22:18:21 <MPQC>	I need your opinion Exo
Jul 23 22:18:38 <MPQC>	If I was to make the firmware more XMB style, resubmit it, would I be banned again
Jul 23 22:18:45 <MPQC>	Since it'll be less similar to his -_-
Jul 23 22:18:56 <Exophase>	Wouldn't you have to be unbanned in the first place?
Jul 23 22:19:08 <MPQC>	I'll be unbanned on the 26th
Jul 23 22:19:16 <Exophase>	I don't really know, Bob thought you were trolling and this would be less obviously trolling. But maybe the real reason he banned you is because he doesn't like people competing with him.
Jul 23 22:19:22 <MPQC>	Gives me plenty time to make it, or at least get something working
Jul 23 22:19:34 <Exophase>	Why are you focusing your energy on a loader instead of a game?
Jul 23 22:19:56 <MPQC>	Because there's going to be enough crap games made, nobody is making something you can customize
Jul 23 22:20:07 <MPQC>	Or bob says his is...But eh
Jul 23 22:20:19 <MPQC>	You can change every single thing on mine down to the scrolling text
Jul 23 22:21:30 <itidus22>	So the idea of an nD game is to use standard C + SDL in 320x240 right?

Jul 23 22:22:52 <MPQC>	If you say so

Jul 23 22:23:21 <itidus22>	I'm just here because I find the whole Bob's Game thing interesting.
Jul 23 22:23:45 <MPQC>	You've got a stupid client Exo
Jul 23 22:24:22 <Exophase>	It's not my client.
Jul 23 22:24:25 <Exophase>	It's other weird stuff.
Jul 23 22:25:04 <itidus22>	And in addition I can see the need for a console which basically goes back to the old rules of UK consoles in the early 80s
Jul 23 22:25:33 <itidus22>	But, with a few modern ideas
Jul 23 22:26:11 <itidus22>	its uh... it's a bit like the spectrum
Jul 23 22:27:42 <emusan>	which idea's are those?
Jul 23 22:27:53 <itidus22>	"The (Sinclair) ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down."
Jul 23 22:28:23 <itidus22>	"The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible."
Jul 23 22:28:30 <MPQC>	Sort of what Jobs did way back when
Jul 23 22:28:54 <itidus22>	so ZX81 is pre-spectrum
Jul 23 22:29:06 <MPQC>	Apple (or whatever company he worked for long time ago) paid him to make the computer more simpler, and he made it so simple that they couldn't manufacture it :P
Jul 23 22:29:37 <itidus22>	so, the strategy is indeed comparable to Clive Sinclair's ZX81
Jul 23 22:29:41 <itidus22>	except applied to a handheld
Jul 23 22:48:52 <Syniphas>	[23:28] <MPQC> Apple (or whatever company he worked for long time ago)
Jul 23 22:48:57 <Syniphas>	jobs sort of uh
Jul 23 22:49:00 <Syniphas>	founded apple
Jul 23 22:49:18 <Syniphas>	i don't think anyone "paid him" to do anything about his own computers really
Jul 23 22:49:23 <MPQC>	Apple fired him too
Jul 23 22:49:30 <MPQC>	Bet you didn't know that
Jul 23 22:49:31 <Syniphas>	yes they did!
Jul 23 22:49:36 <Syniphas>	no i knew that
Jul 23 22:49:41 <Syniphas>	they he went to NeXT
Jul 23 22:49:44 <Syniphas>	then*
Jul 23 22:49:57 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 23 22:50:00 <Syniphas>	and then he came back as CEO
Jul 23 22:50:25 <Syniphas>	but i'm not so sure jobs designed anything at apple after the Lisa
Jul 23 22:50:35 <Syniphas>	he just kind of
Jul 23 22:50:41 <Syniphas>	overlooked everything and got the money
Jul 23 22:55:37 <MPQC>	I'll find you info on it later Syniphas

Jul 24 14:13:35 <Exophase>	Wasn't me.
Jul 24 14:13:44 <Exophase>	You were talking about Steve Jobs?
Jul 24 14:13:55 <MPQC>	Yeah
Jul 24 14:13:55 <Exophase>	Looks like it was Syniphas you were talking to.
Jul 24 14:14:04 <MPQC>	Yeah that guy lol
Jul 24 14:14:31 <MPQC>	Just beat Yoshi's Island on my Dingoo :)
Jul 24 14:15:06 <Exophase>	GBA?
Jul 24 14:15:36 <MPQC>	Yeah
Jul 24 14:15:44 <Exophase>	Cool, did it crash at any point? ;p
Jul 24 14:15:50 <MPQC>	No
Jul 24 14:15:55 <Exophase>	I had stability problems with Yoshi's Island way way back when..
Jul 24 14:15:59 <Exophase>	Well that's good.
Jul 24 14:16:18 <MPQC>	Just stuck it on 400mhz, only used save states, played through perfectly
Jul 24 14:16:23 <Exophase>	Cool.
Jul 24 14:16:30 <Exophase>	Only really tested it on PSP
Jul 24 14:16:32 <Exophase>	And not an awful lot.
Jul 24 14:16:39 <Exophase>	Well I'm sure I tested it on the PC version too..
Jul 24 14:16:41 <MPQC>	PSP has crashing issues :|
Jul 24 14:16:47 <Exophase>	Is that right.
Jul 24 14:16:54 <MPQC>	Especially with SNES
Jul 24 14:17:05 <Exophase>	I don't think it's anything inate about PSP
Jul 24 14:17:11 <Exophase>	Although I know that I let some weird bugs slip into gpSP 0.9
Jul 24 14:17:36 <Exophase>	That weren't there before.. but were fixed in something unreleased that those uo-whatever guys took (was in the GP2X release or something)
Jul 24 14:17:37 <MPQC>	Such as
Jul 24 14:17:49 <Exophase>	Just stuff that came about from rewriting the memory handlers.
Jul 24 14:17:58 <MPQC>	Mk
Jul 24 14:17:58 <Exophase>	That probably resulted in a few crashes/hangs that weren't there before.
Jul 24 14:18:47 <MPQC>	I always had issues with my PSP's analog
Jul 24 14:18:56 <MPQC>	Bought one PSP, analog was crap
Jul 24 14:19:00 <MPQC>	Bought another, analog was crap
Jul 24 14:19:06 <Exophase>	I never liked nubs much in the first place.
Jul 24 14:19:12 <MPQC>	It's garbage
Jul 24 14:19:36 <Exophase>	For me the biggest disappointment on PSP was the poor response time of the LCD.. although I guess that got better later.
Jul 24 14:19:49 <Exophase>	But I know when I first tried emulators on my PSP-1000 it was pretty shocking.
Jul 24 14:20:09 <MPQC>	When I play actual PSP games I notice awful ghosting
Jul 24 14:20:15 <MPQC>	But when doing emulators or the like, I really don't notice anything
Jul 24 14:20:40 <Exophase>	Depends what you're emulating I guess, GBA for instance has games that are mostly bright because the original GBA's screen was so dark..
Jul 24 14:20:45 <Exophase>	So there's less contrast and less ghosting.
Jul 24 14:21:05 <Exophase>	But console games with thick black outlines around the sprites and in the backgrounds ghost very very badly.
Jul 24 14:21:19 <MPQC>	I never noticed anything on PSX,
Jul 24 14:21:29 <MPQC>	Those games are damn dark lol
Jul 24 14:21:44 <Exophase>	Maybe it's not as noticable for 3D stuff
Jul 24 14:22:21 <MPQC>	Well I first noticed it while playing Daxter...mm
Jul 24 14:22:30 <MPQC>	Whichever one it was 
Jul 24 14:22:32 <Exophase>	Is Daxter cell shaded?
Jul 24 14:22:47 <MPQC>	Tbh I don't remember, I could load it up right now though
Jul 24 14:22:56 <Exophase>	I dunno, normal 3D games have less sharp edges/contrast because they use more subtle shading and don't have outlines.
Jul 24 14:22:58 <MPQC>	Disk is somewhere floating around..
Jul 24 14:23:00 <Exophase>	Unless they're cell-shaded.
Jul 24 14:23:43 <MPQC>	No, it's not cell shaded
Jul 24 14:24:28 <MPQC>	The game would be so much better if it had a better analog...
Jul 24 14:25:07 <Exophase>	I never had a lot of PSP games..
Jul 24 14:25:21 <Exophase>	But I had the Katamari Damacy game and of course I wished I had dual analog sticks there..
Jul 24 14:25:44 <MPQC>	Heh, I really didn't buy much games either
Jul 24 14:25:53 <MPQC>	I think I only have about 5 or 6..
Jul 24 14:26:23 <MPQC>	Had to buy the PSP when I got ahold of PSX though
Jul 24 14:39:22 <Kutaghy>	weird
Jul 24 14:39:31 <Kutaghy>	I've got a PSP phat (1k)
Jul 24 14:39:36 <Kutaghy>	havent noticed ghosting
Jul 24 14:39:53 <Kutaghy>	Maybe cuz it is an european version...
Jul 24 14:40:16 <MPQC>	 Hm, I've got 2 1001's (canada)

Jul 24 15:54:53 <Treeki>	I had a PSP-1k from 2005 and it had ghosting issues
Jul 24 15:54:59 <Treeki>	I haven't played it in a long long time though
Jul 24 16:05:54 <Kutagh>	maybe its just an early batch then
Jul 24 16:06:58 <user82>	is anyone around here introduced to the technic a little or is it just bob with details?
Jul 24 16:09:48 <user82>	Treeki ?
Jul 24 16:09:54 <--	JosJuice (~JosJuice@synIRC-A8999FBA.bredband.comhem.se) has left #nD
Jul 24 16:10:08 <Kutagh>	just bob knows the specific details
Jul 24 16:10:10 <Kutagh>	:X
Jul 24 16:10:30 <user82>	yeah..but id like to know how hardware based you can go with the sdk
Jul 24 16:11:08 <user82>	like screw 8 bit microcontrollers for some projects and buy a 10$ nd instead with some broken out pins and a nice feedbakc display included
Jul 24 16:13:17 <Kutagh>	Well
Jul 24 16:13:22 <Kutagh>	details aren't set in stone...
Jul 24 16:13:36 <user82>	sure..i know
Jul 24 16:13:51 <Kutagh>	so ask it on the forum
Jul 24 16:14:15 <Kutagh>	afaik there was some discussion on the hacking of the nD already but never had a concrete answer from bob
Jul 24 16:14:17 <user82>	but youd need sthing like timer control register control...can you inline-assemble in the c++ code in the SDK?
Jul 24 16:14:26 <user82>	i guess?
Jul 24 16:15:01 <MPQC>	How does one develop programs for a device that isn't ready
Jul 24 16:15:40 <beoran>	inline assembly is definitely out until you know what cpu this thing ill have
Jul 24 16:15:55 <Kutagh>	MPQC, the nD is going to have an embedded custom Linux kernel.
Jul 24 16:16:08 <Kutagh>	C++ and SDL is linux-compatible
Jul 24 16:16:17 <user82>	yeah..but generally can i get the datasheet when its out and do all the stuff in inline assembler beoran ? should be working?
Jul 24 16:16:23 <Kutagh>	so in theory bob can relatively easily port it to the nD
Jul 24 16:16:35 <MPQC>	Uh huh
Jul 24 16:16:53 <Kutagh>	code-wise there isnt a lot of a difference between the PC and nD version in the end
Jul 24 16:17:02 <Kutagh>	you just need to compile it with different instructions
Jul 24 16:17:55 <Kutagh>	so MPQC as long as you use C++ and SDL you can just do a lot of the work already
Jul 24 16:18:20 <MPQC>	Time to port my DS version of Tetris, since I don't recall seeing Tetris in his list....
Jul 24 16:18:23 <Kutagh>	and when the nD comes out, you wouldn't have quite a lot left doing, mainly bugfixing
Jul 24 16:18:36 <Exophase>	I'm not sure Bob knows details either..
Jul 24 16:18:46 <Kutagh>	Exophase, ditto :p
Jul 24 16:18:47 <MPQC>	Bob knows nothing
Jul 24 16:19:03 <MPQC>	:P
Jul 24 16:19:15 <Exophase>	user82; I think $10 nD is utterly impossible.
Jul 24 16:19:48 <user82>	Exophase, maybe..but still display and a 400mhz cpu 32bit is quite powerful for some other projects

Jul 24 16:20:18 <Kutagh>	even at $30 it is a worthwhile candidate
Jul 24 16:20:33 <MPQC>	Know what I bet bobs doing?
Jul 24 16:20:33 <Exophase>	Assuming it can be done at all.
Jul 24 16:20:43 <MPQC>	Putting an impossible price to force us to talk about it since we're dumb sheep
Jul 24 16:20:52 <Exophase>	There are some handhelds around that spec level that you can get for $50 or so, possibly used..
Jul 24 16:20:58 <Exophase>	Like a Leapster Didj or a ZipIt
Jul 24 16:21:21 <Exophase>	In fact.
Jul 24 16:21:24 <Exophase>	http://cgi.ebay.com/DIDJ-AND-LEAPSTER-/250857371429?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a6843b725 < see how low it'll go
Jul 24 16:21:31 <Exophase>	No idea what it'll really end up at..
Jul 24 16:21:36 <MPQC>	Never even heard of that
Jul 24 16:21:36 *	Exophase checks some buy it now's
Jul 24 16:21:41 <MPQC>	Leapster that edumacation device?
Jul 24 16:21:46 <Exophase>	MPQC; Same SoC as Wiz/Caanoo
Jul 24 16:21:48 <MPQC>	Can't be, has sonic..
Jul 24 16:21:50 <MPQC>	Oh gotcha
Jul 24 16:21:50 <Exophase>	Someone hacked it at some point.
Jul 24 16:22:00 <MPQC>	Oh that's leapfrog, lol
Jul 24 16:22:19 <Exophase>	Hm, guess that's the only one on eBay..
Jul 24 16:22:21 <MPQC>	Pretty ugly
Jul 24 16:22:32 <Exophase>	Yeah I'm sure nD will win beauty contests.
Jul 24 16:22:47 <MPQC>	It's ugly as heck too
Jul 24 16:23:03 <user82>	i dont believe in 10$ either..but we'll see
Jul 24 16:23:07 <MPQC>	Wiz is beautiful
Jul 24 16:23:24 <user82>	if its over 20 i will call it a fail....that woudl be total unfair and dumb
Jul 24 16:23:29 <Exophase>	http://elinux.org/Didj
Jul 24 16:23:44 <Exophase>	user82; It's extremely unlikely he can sell the hardware for under $20, IMO
Jul 24 16:24:00 <Exophase>	How would it be unfair? Because he announced something for $10, or because you really think this price point is viable?
Jul 24 16:24:41 <user82>	he announced 10-20$ everywhere and did not evne mention it could go higher. plus he needs to know now about the real price a little better
Jul 24 16:24:48 <Exophase>	Well he's kind of an idiot.
Jul 24 16:25:01 <MPQC>	Idiot >> bob
Jul 24 16:25:07 <MPQC>	Synonym
Jul 24 16:25:19 <user82>	well ne needed to have done _some_ research on cpu prices display prices etc...
Jul 24 16:25:35 <Exophase>	Yes, he did, then he assumes that he can get it for a third the price when he places an order for millions.
Jul 24 16:26:14 <Exophase>	And he sees the cheapest Chinese handhelds selling for < $20, not realizing that they're using custom enhanced famiclone ASICs and very low end screens..
Jul 24 16:26:20 <Exophase>	And not at all comparable to what he promises for nD
Jul 24 16:26:39 <MPQC>	http://cgi.ebay.com/Block-Storm-handheld-game-flip-screen-Brand-New-Sealed-/250738863978?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a61336f6a
Jul 24 16:26:41 <MPQC>	:)
Jul 24 16:26:41 <Exophase>	He probably also looks on taobao or alibaba and sees scam prices..
Jul 24 16:26:58 <Exophase>	That either aren't for real sales or hide the real cost in S&H
Jul 24 16:27:27 <Exophase>	MPQC; Wow, more evidence for the $10 nD!
Jul 24 16:27:38 <MPQC>	Did you even look at it?
Jul 24 16:27:39 <Exophase>	Anyway, even if it is his goal to sell at cost it doesn't mean he can get investors to agree to it.
Jul 24 16:27:44 <Exophase>	MPQC; I'm being sarcastic.
Jul 24 16:27:47 <MPQC>	lolol
Jul 24 16:27:50 <MPQC>	I've got one of them ^_^
Jul 24 16:27:50 <user82>	case 4$ display 8$ pcb 3§ battery 2$ is quite plausible in my oppinion. but what does a 400mhz arm cost?
Jul 24 16:28:03 <Exophase>	user82 come on
Jul 24 16:28:14 <Exophase>	The cheapest ARM9 SoCs are about $6, that doesn't include audio.
Jul 24 16:28:24 <Exophase>	The one he linked for instance, i.MX28
Jul 24 16:28:27 <Exophase>	Of course that doesn't include RAM either
Jul 24 16:28:40 <user82>	20$? and NAND 5$?
Jul 24 16:28:43 <Exophase>	So you're thinking $10 including NO electrical components??
Jul 24 16:28:45 <MPQC>	Wait, he has links for what parts he wants to use?
Jul 24 16:28:59 <Exophase>	MPQC; No, he just gave a link to an i.MX28 as an example of SoC pricing.
Jul 24 16:29:06 <MPQC>	Oh ic
Jul 24 16:29:32 <Exophase>	Don't forget he also said it'll have wifi, that's at least $5.
Jul 24 16:29:34 <Exophase>	But probably more.
Jul 24 16:29:57 <user82>	http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=i.MX280&tab=Buy_Parametric_Tab&nodeId=018rH3ZrDRA24A&pspll=1&fromSearch=false
Jul 24 16:30:03 <user82>	not that pricy is it?
Jul 24 16:30:21 <Exophase>	It's exactly what I said user82, $6, no audio
Jul 24 16:30:40 <ProPuke>	what about manufacturing costs? No one's going to build it for free. (Is the cost likely to be relatively low given the unit "expectations"?)
Jul 24 16:31:17 <Exophase>	ProPuke; Yeah that's what I'm saying.
Jul 24 16:31:47 <user82>	Exophase, he said wireless or wifi?
Jul 24 16:31:51 <Kutagh>	ProPuke, expectations...... you'd still be safe to say 'dreams'
Jul 24 16:31:52 <Exophase>	wifi
Jul 24 16:32:15 <user82>	wifi..ups. yea another 5$ or so
Jul 24 16:32:56 <ProPuke>	Mmm
Jul 24 16:33:25 <ProPuke>	he could always build them himself in his garage :D
Jul 24 16:33:49 <Exophase>	ProPuke; Yeah I'm sure that'll handle capacity in the millions.
Jul 24 16:34:32 <user82>	sure will
Jul 24 16:34:46 <ProPuke>	Oh my! You are correct. What was I thinking? :o
Jul 24 16:35:15 <Exophase>	i.MX28 is nice because it has an integrated PMIC
Jul 24 16:35:32 <Exophase>	Still no audio on the one you linked though, that's another $1 or so for the codec.
Jul 24 16:36:05 <user82>	yeah..but i guess 25$ mass production is doable
Jul 24 16:36:25 <Exophase>	I doubt it'll get below $30.
Jul 24 16:36:39 <Exophase>	Especially if sold in brick & mortar stores which it pretty much has to be to sell millions to children.
Jul 24 16:37:34 <--	[]J has quit (Ping timeout)
Jul 24 16:37:44 <user82>	cpu 6 audio 1 case 4 display 6 nand 4 battery 3 pcb 3 wifi 5..not so pessimistic ;). i guess we all have to wait and see what bob does
Jul 24 16:37:59 <user82>	30 might be
Jul 24 16:38:05 <MPQC>	"600mhz cpu because i have extra money to spare for the $10 limit"
Jul 24 16:38:16 <user82>	who said that...
Jul 24 16:38:31 <MPQC>	It's my prediction of what Bob will say

Jul 24 16:38:50 <Exophase>	All gonna be moot if he doesn't get investor money. He has no money to his name.
Jul 24 16:38:50 <user82>	hmhyeah..
Jul 24 16:39:31 <Exophase>	Meanwhile this is $50, or it was years ago.. http://www.zipitwireless.com/default.aspx?skinid=1
Jul 24 16:39:48 <Exophase>	Although it's not a gaming handheld, so not a great comparison. But if you just want the hardware..
Jul 24 16:40:14 <Exophase>	Bob wants to make money on games, so I'm sure it'd be bad news if he did make millions of them and they all got turned into cheap PMPs or something.
Jul 24 16:41:10 <Exophase>	http://cgi.ebay.com/Zipit-Wireless-Messenger-2-Z2-New-/150635953722?pt=PDA_s_Pocket_PC_s&hash=item23129a3e3a < $35
Jul 24 16:42:13 <user82>	nintendo ds wifi module 6$ on ebay..he'll probably get it for 4 if he does a good deal with a wifi module
Jul 24 16:42:34 <user82>	cannot wait for 2011 to end and the nd details to appear ;)
Jul 24 16:42:47 <Exophase>	Sounds good, a wifi module that can't even support WPA2
Jul 24 16:42:59 <user82>	really?
Jul 24 16:43:07 <MPQC>	DS only supports WEP
Jul 24 16:43:19 <user82>	well he said multiplayer gaming...stroooong encryption needed i guess :P
Jul 24 16:43:27 <user82>	or did he mean via internet?
Jul 24 16:43:41 <user82>	(i assumed ad-hoc not even wifi needed just some slow crappy module)
Jul 24 16:44:10 <Exophase>	I'm sure he means at least connecting to a local hotspot to get to the app store.
Jul 24 16:44:27 <Exophase>	Buying wireless for multiplayer on this thing is a waste of money, IMO
Jul 24 16:44:40 <Exophase>	Of course, in his mind he really see lots of kids having this.
Jul 24 16:44:55 <user82>	think of kids in classroom ;)
Jul 24 16:44:58 <Exophase>	But in the real world he'll have to be happy with only thousands of sales..
Jul 24 16:45:08 <Exophase>	Yeah, because kids think cheap and open is so cool.
Jul 24 16:45:12 <user82>	"It's $10 for the system, and $20 for the system and "bob's game.""
Jul 24 16:45:18 <Exophase>	And indie 2D games are all the rage with children.
Jul 24 16:45:18 <user82>	still optimistic the guy..
Jul 24 16:45:49 <user82>	well if they got less money..but maybe modern kids are too ignorant and need a cool 400$ psp?
Jul 24 16:45:56 <Exophase>	If a parent buys their kid an nD instead of a Nintendo or Sony handheld they probably won't be very happy about it.
Jul 24 16:46:09 <Exophase>	You're the one who sounds ignorant calling PSP $400.
Jul 24 16:46:29 <user82>	i got no clue what it costs
Jul 24 16:46:31 <Exophase>	What's ignorant about preferring a handheld with vastly superior capabilities and vastly more third party development?
Jul 24 16:46:35 <--	MPQC has quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.87 [Firefox 5.0/20110615151330])
Jul 24 16:46:43 <Exophase>	Well at least you admit you're ignorant ;p
Jul 24 16:46:50 <user82>	why?
Jul 24 16:46:56 <Exophase>	Why what?
Jul 24 16:47:03 <user82>	i said kids might be ignorant
Jul 24 16:47:15 <user82>	and need a modern psp or nds with 3d
Jul 24 16:47:18 <Exophase>	I just don't see what ignorance has to do with it.
Jul 24 16:47:33 <Exophase>	Attributing personal taste to knowledge is pretty elitist.
Jul 24 16:47:33 <user82>	i geuss they dont get the concept of "fun" or "indie"
Jul 24 16:47:45 <user82>	they just want it to show off
Jul 24 16:47:49 <Exophase>	It's not your place to decide what other people find fun.
Jul 24 16:48:06 <Exophase>	Can you really speak for everyone?
Jul 24 16:48:24 <user82>	then why do you think it wont be sold to kids often?
Jul 24 16:48:30 <Exophase>	nD?
Jul 24 16:48:42 <user82>	yes
Jul 24 16:48:56 <Exophase>	Because other platforms will offer games they like more.
Jul 24 16:49:06 <user82>	ok
Jul 24 16:49:44 <Exophase>	Why have other companies consistently had so much trouble against Nintendo in the handheld space?
Jul 24 16:49:56 <Exophase>	Do you think no one has ever tried?
Jul 24 16:50:10 <beoran>	Exophase: it's the name
Jul 24 16:50:15 <beoran>	the fame of the name
Jul 24 16:50:16 <Exophase>	No it isn't.
Jul 24 16:50:19 <user82>	super mario defeated nintendo 
Jul 24 16:50:23 <user82>	!!!
Jul 24 16:50:25 <Exophase>	Defeated??
Jul 24 16:50:35 <beoran>	and the first party games, of course
Jul 24 16:50:40 <Exophase>	Yes, the first party games.
Jul 24 16:50:42 <beoran>	defendezd, he probably means
Jul 24 16:50:43 <user82>	against other opponents in the handheld space..and it was a joke
Jul 24 16:50:59 <user82>	yeah..true
Jul 24 16:51:06 <beoran>	zelda and mario are great games
Jul 24 16:51:15 <Exophase>	Bob essentially expects to sell nD on the strength of its first party games.
Jul 24 16:51:27 <beoran>	he will need better ones! 
Jul 24 16:51:37 <Treeki>	I used my PSP as an emulation device for Nintendo games
Jul 24 16:51:39 <Treeki>	then I got a DS
Jul 24 16:51:45 <Treeki>	there were very few PSP games that interested me
Jul 24 16:52:21 <user82>	i think he will do some sales if the nd is actually out and cheap...but i also dont think he will reach millions of kids
Jul 24 16:52:46 <Exophase>	But without millions of sales it's not really commercially viable.
Jul 24 16:52:54 <beoran>	user82: you love speculative fiction, it seems :)
Jul 24 16:52:55 <Exophase>	To sell hardware at cost.
Jul 24 16:53:17 <user82>	beoran, sure. or why does a channel about a device that does not exist exist ;)
Jul 24 16:53:18 <Exophase>	When I say millions of sales, I mean millions of first party software sales of course.
Jul 24 16:53:33 <Treeki>	I personally wouldn't develop a game for nD without a large install base
Jul 24 16:53:44 <Treeki>	unless it was cross platform, and that'd kinda kill the nD advantage
Jul 24 16:53:47 <Exophase>	You need millions of hardware sales to get millions of software sales (or within an order of magnitude difference or so)
Jul 24 16:53:59 <beoran>	Treeki: well, if SDL is the API, then it's very easy to port. But then again, there is less appeal
Jul 24 16:54:07 <Exophase>	But millions of hardware sales doesn't equal millions of software sales, and selling millions of nDs without selling a lot of games is the worst possible scenario for him.
Jul 24 16:54:35 <user82>	he would not be able to pay investors back you mean?
Jul 24 16:54:43 <Treeki>	kinda, but you still have to take into account stuff like control schemes (lack of buttons on iOS and Android) and all that
Jul 24 16:54:45 <beoran>	And nintendo is in the games business longer than anyone else because they learned from the vide games crash of 1983
Jul 24 16:54:46 <Exophase>	user82; Yes
Jul 24 16:55:01 <Treeki>	and you have to develop for the lowest common denominator, spec-wise (probably the nD)
Jul 24 16:55:08 <user82>	i would buy some games..but i sure would not spend too much on 'em as the device is cheap
Jul 24 16:55:16 <beoran>	they learned 1) keep tich control of who can make games for the platform 2) never sell at loos or at cost. always make a profit on the console/handheld
Jul 24 16:55:46 <user82>	anyway hope his planes work. but his mind also seems to be a little locked in his room and optimistic world ;)
Jul 24 16:55:55 <beoran>	and 3) make good first party games
Jul 24 16:56:00 <Exophase>	Selling at loss/cost can be a very effective marketing strategy, Sony did wonders with PS1 and PS2, and I think you could say PS3 eventually became what you'd consider a financial success.
Jul 24 16:56:19 <beoran>	Exophase: it remains to be seen if that strategy will pan out in the long run
Jul 24 16:56:29 <Exophase>	But that only works if you've got very well established software development. Sony doing it with PS1 was risky, but obviously they had lots of their own money to invest.
Jul 24 16:56:46 <Exophase>	beoran; Hardly, we're talking about like 17 years of it having panned out.
Jul 24 16:57:05 <Exophase>	Vs another 11 or so years of Nintendo selling consoles before that?
Jul 24 16:57:06 <beoran>	there will be anext video game crash soon, I feel, in the next 5 years. 
Jul 24 16:57:16 <Exophase>	Now who's spreading speculative fiction.
Jul 24 16:57:26 <beoran>	then only Ninty has a chance to survive. 
Jul 24 16:57:36 <beoran>	the phones will do it
Jul 24 16:57:59 <Exophase>	Phones threaten handhelds, not all consoles.
Jul 24 16:58:18 <beoran>	http://www.talkandroid.com/37173-android-eating-into-nintendo-ds-market-share-nom-nom-nom/
Jul 24 16:58:26 <Exophase>	What did I just say..
Jul 24 16:58:47 <beoran>	And then the phone relaces the PC., which becomes a mere docking station. :)
Jul 24 16:58:53 <Exophase>	Also it's misleading to merely look at percentages.
Jul 24 16:58:58 <Exophase>	Without looking at overall market capacity.
Jul 24 16:59:10 <beoran>	sure, but I see a trend there
Jul 24 16:59:16 <Exophase>	Phones have a higher percentage, but have also grown the market a lot.
Jul 24 16:59:29 <beoran>	also, phone games cost 0.99$ 
Jul 24 16:59:33 <user82>	correct me if i am wrong. he sells the nd at cost so he does not really risk anything if he sells the hardware?
Jul 24 16:59:34 <Exophase>	Not all of them.
Jul 24 16:59:42 <beoran>	which is what people /want/ to pay for games, these days
Jul 24 16:59:53 <beoran>	well, yes, it goes up to +- $9.99
Jul 24 16:59:56 <Exophase>	Not everyone.
Jul 24 17:00:04 <beoran>	No, I studied this. 
Jul 24 17:00:19 <Exophase>	Oh okay, I'm sorry, NO ONE is willing to pay more than $10 for a game.
Jul 24 17:00:23 <Treeki>	also, am I the only one who's noticed that bob has two alter egos on the nD site
Jul 24 17:00:25 <Exophase>	I was wrong by saying "not everyone"
Jul 24 17:00:26 <Treeki>	"admin" and "bob"
Jul 24 17:00:31 <Exophase>	I never noticed a bob on the nD site.
Jul 24 17:00:41 <Treeki>	see the games page
Jul 24 17:00:47 <Exophase>	Humn
Jul 24 17:00:47 <Treeki>	http://the-nd.com/forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=3
Jul 24 17:00:49 <Exophase>	That's Bob for you.
Jul 24 17:01:00 <beoran>	http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/android-and-iphone-apps-cost-about-the-same-except-for-games-and-dictionaries/
Jul 24 17:01:03 <Exophase>	Man he has some crazy hair.
Jul 24 17:01:03 <Treeki>	bob's game is credited to "bob", and the nD firmware is credited to "admin"
Jul 24 17:01:07 <user82>	learn from music industry...14$ for a album->illeagla copies sales break down. i guess you have to try selling a massive amount for around 1-3$(like ipad apps etc)
Jul 24 17:01:14 <Treeki>	oh, and the forum member list is off for some reason
Jul 24 17:01:41 <beoran>	average game price is 2.5$
Jul 24 17:01:47 <Exophase>	You can't develop NEW 3D games that sell at $3, and people will still want new 3D games.
Jul 24 17:01:51 <Exophase>	beoran, no shit
Jul 24 17:01:58 <Exophase>	I don't know what you think you're arguing on this.
Jul 24 17:02:05 <Exophase>	Or what you think I am and am not opposing.
Jul 24 17:02:29 <beoran>	no, i'm not even arguing, I think? 
Jul 24 17:02:54 <Exophase>	You're posting links to things everyone already knows that SEEM to be for the purpose of reinforcing an argument no one is disagreeing with.
Jul 24 17:03:16 <beoran>	Exophase: well, sory it seemed like you were disagreeing. 
Jul 24 17:03:31 <user82>	i expected bollocking.... http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=249
Jul 24 17:03:45 <user82>	well its not intended by him of course..i was clear on that
Jul 24 17:03:45 <beoran>	actually I see your point. For hardcore games who want 3d games ,consoles remain an option. 
Jul 24 17:04:02 <Exophase>	user82; Seriously, why would Bob want to sell cheap dev hardware to people?
Jul 24 17:04:11 <Exophase>	Who don't want to make games?
Jul 24 17:04:13 <Exophase>	Er.
Jul 24 17:04:14 <Exophase>	Whoops.
Jul 24 17:04:17 <Exophase>	Don't want to BUY games.
Jul 24 17:04:17 <user82>	if he sells at cost nothing is lost?
Jul 24 17:04:24 <Exophase>	Far from it.
Jul 24 17:04:28 <Exophase>	What does cost mean, user82?
Jul 24 17:04:32 <Exophase>	BOM cost?
Jul 24 17:04:36 <Exophase>	That neglects the entire R&D cost.
Jul 24 17:04:40 <Exophase>	And cost of marketing.
Jul 24 17:04:49 <Exophase>	He's talking about running ads during Saturday morning cartoons.
Jul 24 17:04:55 <user82>	if he sells it for the production costs..he wont lose anything if i buy a second one for DIY'ing
Jul 24 17:04:56 <Exophase>	To entice all the kiddies.
Jul 24 17:05:09 <user82>	well ok..sure
Jul 24 17:05:12 <Exophase>	See, that's obviously false, if production costs mean the per-unit costs.
Jul 24 17:05:21 <user82>	yeah
Jul 24 17:05:33 <user82>	well if i buy a second one besides one for gaming..why not
Jul 24 17:05:39 <Exophase>	Why would you need two??
Jul 24 17:05:43 <user82>	also if he will deny it works as a microcontroller
Jul 24 17:06:15 <Exophase>	Of course it works as a microcontroller, for some definition of a microcontroller (the SoC he'll be using will be more in the domain of "apps processor" though)
Jul 24 17:06:20 <user82>	take one apart..use it as microcontroller. even the cheap atmega's cost 6$ (8 bit 20mhz) for private ppl
Jul 24 17:06:24 <Exophase>	ie, no embedded RAM, poor hard-realtime characteristics
Jul 24 17:06:29 <Exophase>	Take it apart, why??
Jul 24 17:06:35 <Exophase>	You think it'll have a bunch of test points to solder to?
Jul 24 17:06:46 <user82>	thats what might be the problem
Jul 24 17:06:49 <Exophase>	Man, you sound really cheap.
Jul 24 17:06:57 <user82>	thanks
Jul 24 17:06:58 <Exophase>	All of this talk over saving what, a couple dozen dollars?
Jul 24 17:07:00 <Exophase>	Well, sorry ;p
Jul 24 17:07:18 <Exophase>	But it just amazes me that developers are this conscious over a few dollars, for a device that'll come out in over a year..
Jul 24 17:07:39 <Exophase>	You can get 32-bit microcontroller eval boards for under $50..
Jul 24 17:08:13 -->	Mr_Gnome (~Mr_Gnome@synIRC-A057FF8F.dr01.hmdl.id.frontiernet.net) has joined #nD
Jul 24 17:08:18 <Exophase>	And you're saying how you'll be outraged if this costs $30 instead of $10-20
Jul 24 17:08:22 <Exophase>	Maybe I'm kind of out of touch though.
Jul 24 17:08:40 <Exophase>	So I don't really understand what that price difference might mean to some people, but to me that's the cost of a large pizza or something.
Jul 24 17:09:11 <Exophase>	If we were talking $200 vs $400 I could understand but we aren't..
Jul 24 17:09:31 <Exophase>	And if we were talking a 10 year old spending his allowance I could understand too..
Jul 24 17:09:56 <user82>	your oppinion...ok. but a arm9 board with display battery wifi and usb programming i have not seen really cheap..
Jul 24 17:10:05 <beoran>	Exophase: there are many young and/or poor developers, it seems.
Jul 24 17:10:23 <Exophase>	beoran; I think we're talking REALLY poor, yet not poor enough to have a computer to do their development on.
Jul 24 17:10:28 <Exophase>	And pay for internet each month.
Jul 24 17:10:37 <Exophase>	Young, okay, but how young?
Jul 24 17:10:40 <user82>	do i need to apologize for not spending more money than i need?
Jul 24 17:10:50 <Exophase>	No, I'm not attacking you, I just think it's strange.
Jul 24 17:10:56 <user82>	ok.
Jul 24 17:11:14 <Exophase>	I don't know what the cheapest you can get an ARM9 board with display for.. for wifi use a cheap USB dongle.
Jul 24 17:11:22 <user82>	if you tell me where to get a board with a powerful arm..i totally get your point
Jul 24 17:11:33 <Exophase>	I can tell you where to get a Cortex-M3 board for under $50.
Jul 24 17:11:39 <Exophase>	But it won't have an LCD, or much of anything.
Jul 24 17:11:52 <beoran>	 you connect a vga monitor :)
Jul 24 17:11:57 <user82>	that was my point. i was jsut thinking of it as possibility 
Jul 24 17:11:57 <Exophase>	Not to a Cortex-M3.
Jul 24 17:12:29 <Exophase>	When you're talking microcontroller you're looking at components that are usually not connected to displays, although I do know of Cortex-M3 boards that have LCDs. But they're slow interfaces, by and large.
Jul 24 17:12:35 <user82>	i did not say i need to save the 30 bucks really urgent...i was just thinking it might be a easy development platform with a lcd included and so on
Jul 24 17:12:37 <Exophase>	Not meant for driving some 1024x768 screen.
Jul 24 17:12:57 <Exophase>	user82; Seems moot though, if it doesn't give you what an eval board does.
Jul 24 17:13:00 <Exophase>	ie, access to pins
Jul 24 17:13:01 <user82>	i have a propeller..it works with cga
Jul 24 17:13:08 <user82>	*vga
Jul 24 17:13:10 <Exophase>	Oh god, Propeller.
Jul 24 17:13:18 <Exophase>	Hey, there's your cheap 32-bit chip.
Jul 24 17:13:21 <user82>	yeah sure..i need to check that out. perhaps its pure bull****
Jul 24 17:13:21 <Exophase>	Cheap, awful 32-bit chip.
Jul 24 17:13:24 <Exophase>	I don't like Propeller ;p
Jul 24 17:13:44 <Exophase>	As for your other question, if you want to do your entire program in assembler I doubt you'll have a problem.
Jul 24 17:13:48 <user82>	its fun...but pic and atmel do better stuff in my oppinion
Jul 24 17:13:51 <Exophase>	Although at this point I don't see why you'd do inline ASM
Jul 24 17:13:55 <Exophase>	Ugh PIC
Jul 24 17:14:03 <Exophase>	Another crappy uarch. AVR is a lot nicer though
Jul 24 17:14:08 <user82>	i use atmel myself...avr
Jul 24 17:14:20 <Exophase>	I'm sure most enthusiasts do.
Jul 24 17:14:21 <user82>	644pa is my favourite controller so far
Jul 24 17:14:31 <Exophase>	Me, I prefer Cortex-M3s if you haven't realized.
Jul 24 17:14:34 <user82>	im more like beginner than enthusiast
Jul 24 17:14:52 <Exophase>	One thing I like about STM32F10x Cortex-M3s is the ability to program over UART
Jul 24 17:15:01 <user82>	ah ok..might get one but not that high on my priority list with many unfinished projects...like the reprap mendel
Jul 24 17:15:55 <user82>	uart is fine...little old but it works great and is simple. i guess for hobby its a good thing
Jul 24 17:16:20 <Exophase>	http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=218 < ah, it's nice when Bob goes into defensive prick mode
Jul 24 17:16:23 <user82>	need to get some sleep. cu tomorrow
Jul 24 17:16:30 <Exophase>	user82; You can program over USB on newer ones.
Jul 24 17:16:37 <user82>	oh. send me the arm coretex link perhaps?
Jul 24 17:16:50 <Exophase>	Dig around stmicro's site
Jul 24 17:17:00 <Exophase>	G'night
Jul 24 17:17:17 <Exophase>	Haha, wow, Bob goes from defensive prick to racist in that post..
Jul 24 17:17:33 <user82>	Exophase, i got a usbtinyisp. not that advaced yet also id like to work with the v-usb
Jul 24 17:17:48 <Exophase>	Dunno what that is :e
Jul 24 17:17:58 <user82>	simple in system programmer
Jul 24 17:18:13 <user82>	14 bucks
Jul 24 17:18:22 <user82>	do you have the dev board links before i leave?
Jul 24 17:18:33 <Exophase>	Sorry, don't have anything on me right now.
Jul 24 17:20:12 <user82>	his last sentence makes sense...
Jul 24 17:20:47 <user82>	that is why arduino works basically. although its a good thing !
Jul 24 17:20:47 <Exophase>	Of course a programmer will call programming easy.
Jul 24 17:21:04 <user82>	i meant the gui easy development thing
Jul 24 17:21:16 <Exophase>	Someone like that has probably never had to tutor people in programming who have absolutely no aptitude for it.
Jul 24 17:21:19 <user82>	but programming is easy for him sure...but c++ is not i know
Jul 24 17:21:46 <user82>	i meant the scaing off people.
Jul 24 17:21:48 <user82>	scaring
Jul 24 17:21:48 <Exophase>	It's only easy for the people whom it is easy for.
Jul 24 17:21:51 <user82>	g2g
Jul 24 17:21:55 <Exophase>	Bye.
Jul 24 17:21:59 <user82>	bye
Jul 24 17:22:04 <--	user82 has quit (Client exited)
Jul 24 17:24:22 <Mr_Gnome>	Exophase, I've done that before and it was a pain... I gave up about two weeks into teaching them
Jul 24 17:24:44 <Exophase>	Yeah, and I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate being told it's easy, and maybe they're just really stupid..
Jul 24 17:24:55 <Exophase>	It's all relative, people process information differently.
Jul 24 17:26:03 <Kutagh>	tbh, programming is at itself easy
Jul 24 17:26:15 <Exophase>	It's easy to you.
Jul 24 17:26:16 <Kutagh>	its the thinking process behind it that is hard for novices
Jul 24 17:26:42 <Kutagh>	people think its easy to build up something huge
Jul 24 17:26:45 <Exophase>	Some people take to it very well, some don't. I've known plenty of college students who can barely do elementary school level math..
Jul 24 17:26:52 <Kutagh>	or they view it as one huge thing
Jul 24 17:26:56 <Mr_Gnome>	Very true. Someone I'm teaching now just got to data structures and queries me about 15 times a day how to do the same thing he did yesterday just because it does something slightly different.
Jul 24 17:27:32 <Kutagh>	exactly
Jul 24 17:29:42 <Kutagh>	as well as quite a bunch of 'wannabe programmers' just dive into the harder things without learning and practising the basics and then go 'pfff this is too hard... programming easy? idiots!'
Jul 24 17:29:52 <Mr_Gnome>	Though I do find it funny to throw them about 400 lines of pure craziness and watch them go insane trying to understand it.
Jul 24 17:30:00 <Kutagh>	you sadist...
Jul 24 17:30:01 <Kutagh>	lol
Jul 24 17:30:35 <Mr_Gnome>	Hey at least I'm not sending them ASM or something xD
Jul 24 17:30:41 <Kutagh>	xD
Jul 24 17:34:23 <Mr_Gnome>	I wish the nD used SFML
Jul 24 17:35:46 <Mr_Gnome>	Actually... nvm sweet I can use Vala (just compile it to C)
Jul 24 17:39:20 <Kutagh>	dunno if Vala supports SDL...
Jul 24 17:39:26 <Treeki>	it does
Jul 24 17:39:35 <Treeki>	Vala can easily bind to any C library, since it just generates C code
Jul 24 17:40:08 <Kutagh>	heh k
Jul 24 17:40:12 <Kutagh>	then it should work
Jul 24 17:40:42 <Kutagh>	Valadoc comments look better than the C# comments p
Jul 24 17:40:49 <Kutagh>	documentation comments*
Jul 24 17:40:49 <Kutagh>	:p
Jul 24 17:41:05 <Treeki>	keep in mind that you would need GObject, though
Jul 24 17:41:12 <Treeki>	and probably GLib (can't remember if Vala itself depends on that or not)
Jul 24 17:41:29 <Kutagh>	Vala: no implicit inheritance from Object (GLib.Object)
Jul 24 17:41:38 <Kutagh>	I guess you need GLib :p
Jul 24 17:41:55 <Treeki>	afaik Dova isn't mature enough to use yet
Jul 24 17:42:57 <Kutagh>	am looking at the C# vs Vala comparison at Vala site
Jul 24 17:43:12 <Kutagh>	am not happy with no operator overloading
Jul 24 17:43:35 <Treeki>	I suspect that's a legacy of GObject
Jul 24 17:43:48 <Kutagh>	yeah likely
Jul 24 17:43:57 <Treeki>	it'd be rather awkward to do in C code
Jul 24 17:44:04 <Treeki>	then again, GObject C code always looks awkward
Jul 24 17:44:21 <Mr_Gnome>	^ why they made vala
Jul 24 17:46:21 <Kutagh>	what I like is that you can actually have implemented methods in Vala
Jul 24 17:46:25 <Kutagh>	in interfaces
Jul 24 17:47:19 <Kutagh>	also nice, enums with methods
Jul 24 17:49:17 <Mr_Gnome>	Yeah I feel very sad when I have to go back to C or C++ anymore after dealing with Vala... it's very elegant. Now only if Vala supported C++ then it would almost be perfect
Jul 24 17:49:18 <Kutagh>	oh nice, default option for properties
Jul 24 17:51:45 <Kutagh>	also nice, methods that require some conditions
Jul 24 17:58:26 <Mr_Gnome>	Thanks Treeki I hadn't actually heard of Dova

Jul 25 07:34:06 <user82>	how is bob going to protect games from being pirated with an open source firmware?
Jul 25 07:37:57 <itidus22>	ahh i see timic is also from victoria
Jul 25 07:38:05 <Timic>	:D
Jul 25 07:38:36 <itidus22>	yeah.. what are the odds.. 
Jul 25 07:39:05 <itidus22>	melbourne people are clearly a target market for the nD
Jul 25 07:39:09 <user82>	easy calculable! Let's......(sheldon :P)
Jul 25 07:39:36 <Timic>	its true
Jul 25 07:39:41 <Timic>	my friend also likes the nD :)
Jul 25 07:41:03 <itidus22>	user82: piracy can't really be completely stopped.. it can just be managed
Jul 25 07:41:07 <Kutagh>	and user82, open source or closed source.... both are hackable
Jul 25 07:41:36 <user82>	i just meant he can absolutely not assume no one does it he has to figure out some protection at least?
Jul 25 07:41:45 <Kutagh>	best method would be by having public keys stored on the NAND
Jul 25 07:41:56 <Kutagh>	and the games containing private keys
Jul 25 07:41:57 <[]Java>	"death ray" ie the death ray that is targeted at the project which will nuke it from existance
Jul 25 07:41:59 <user82>	who will develop for a system with no protection whatsoever
Jul 25 07:42:13 <Kutagh>	user82, the ones that are gonna make free games anyway
Jul 25 07:42:13 <Kutagh>	lol
Jul 25 07:42:28 <user82>	yep..sure
Jul 25 07:42:50 <Kutagh>	anyway there is a way to make it pretty secure
Jul 25 07:42:59 <user82>	bobs server needs to be contacted via wifi before playing games :P
Jul 25 07:43:01 <Kutagh>	if the game is properly programmed to also verify the firmware
Jul 25 07:43:31 <Kutagh>	by requesting a public key and hash it and verify that against the private key
Jul 25 07:43:32 <user82>	that would be possible..games are just compiled binaries without source then
Jul 25 07:47:01 <Kutagh>	and if ya want added security at firmware-level
Jul 25 07:47:14 <Kutagh>	make sure the keys are in an encrypted file
Jul 25 07:47:30 <Kutagh>	which gets decrypted by the OS using a token
Jul 25 07:47:45 <Kutagh>	which is received from the game
Jul 25 07:47:49 <Kutagh>	(the token)
Jul 25 07:47:57 <Kutagh>	then verify that key against your own

Aug 02 19:11:47 <gBev>	what happened?

Aug 02 19:12:01 <Kutagh>	>.>
Aug 02 19:12:43 <Exophase>	Were just talking about how polite and charming he is.
Aug 02 19:12:52 <gBev>	huh
Aug 02 19:12:56 <gBev>	someone explain D:
Aug 02 19:12:59 <Exophase>	I was amazed to see he asked me to join his team AGAIN today
Aug 02 19:13:05 <Exophase>	ANd I think he resents me for not doing so..
Aug 02 19:13:22 <Exophase>	But that might be why he hasn't banned me yet.
Aug 02 19:13:42 <gBev>	wait so bob wants you to join his team?
Aug 02 19:13:49 <Kutagh>	sounds like it
Aug 02 19:13:55 <Exophase>	I'm sure he won't now
Aug 02 19:14:02 <gBev>	why?
Aug 02 19:14:02 <Kutagh>	but who would even want to be associated with bob
Aug 02 19:14:05 <Exophase>	Although I was sure he would have stopped wanting to already..
Aug 02 19:14:10 <Exophase>	http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=281
Aug 02 19:14:14 <Exophase>	I don't know why gBev, I really don't.
Aug 02 19:14:27 <Kutagh>	bob's reputation: Downright rude to potential developers and customers.
Aug 02 19:14:30 <Exophase>	He doesn't need software people now, what he needs are good EEs
Aug 02 19:14:43 <Exophase>	The link was what we were really talking about.
Aug 02 19:14:50 <gBev>	i'd stay away from association with him
Aug 02 19:14:57 <Kutagh>	same, gBev 
Aug 02 19:15:11 <Exophase>	I'm not afraid of working with a moron.
Aug 02 19:15:22 <Exophase>	I mean, that's not why I wouldn't.
Aug 02 19:15:22 <gBev>	i would have liked to work with him a couple years ago
Aug 02 19:15:24 <gBev>	but not now
Aug 02 19:15:41 <Exophase>	I don't think it would damage me to have my name in the same paragraph as his', I mean
Aug 02 19:15:52 <Exophase>	I don't care if anyone thinks less of me because of him, but I'm not trying to start a career,
Aug 02 19:16:20 <Treeki>	heh
Aug 02 19:16:21 <Exophase>	I know my workplace couldn't possibly care less about things like that, nor would any future one.
Aug 02 19:16:28 <Treeki>	"if you want to argue with me on even ground, why don't you change your nick to your real name first- that's a start."
Aug 02 19:16:31 <Treeki>	says the one who posts as "admin"
Aug 02 19:16:39 <Kutagh>	Treeki, scroll up.. I said the same ;)
Aug 02 19:16:47 <Exophase>	Yep.
Aug 02 19:16:56 <Exophase>	I PMed him giving him my name although I don't know why he cared.
Aug 02 19:17:00 <Treeki>	oh, I mostly skimmed that
Aug 02 19:17:03 <gBev>	most of my usernames are jokes, don't judge
Aug 02 19:17:03 <Kutagh>	:p
Aug 02 19:17:16 <Exophase>	I've heard the same thing from people who post with their real name before..
Aug 02 19:17:25 <Exophase>	About how everyone else is too "cowardly" or "immature" or whatever.
Aug 02 19:17:27 <Exophase>	It's pretty insulting.
Aug 02 19:17:46 <gBev>	 they're probably using a fake name anyway
Aug 02 19:17:48 <Exophase>	The thing with bob these days is that he takes any argument to be a personal attack
Aug 02 19:17:48 <gBev>	brb
Aug 02 19:18:13 <Kutagh>	Exophase, not just any argument.... just about every discussion :X
Aug 02 19:18:14 <Exophase>	While he makes several of his own..
Aug 02 19:18:19 <Exophase>	Kutagh; So it would appear.
Aug 02 19:18:27 <Exophase>	What I don't get is why someone who claims to revel in negative attention is so sensitive.

Aug 02 19:22:45 ---	Received a CTCP VERSION from StatServ
Aug 02 19:23:05 <Lordy>	Well, he is just a big dissapointment.
Aug 02 19:23:51 <Kutaghs>	I sincerely hope bob hasn't received any funding at all from any investor....
Aug 02 19:23:51 <Exophase>	He has obviously done a ton of work on Bob's Game, it'd be a shame if he doesn't follow through on it.
Aug 02 19:23:59 <Kutaghs>	cuz if he did, I feel sorry for the investor =.=
Aug 02 19:24:15 <Exophase>	Did a lot of people also think it was bad on PC? Because it seemed fine to me. Yeah, people complained about the filtering, but you can turn that off >_<
Aug 02 19:24:19 <Exophase>	I mean, he could have.
Aug 02 19:24:28 <Lordy>	I thought it was fine.
Aug 02 19:24:39 <Lordy>	But I think he doesn't want this to end.
Aug 02 19:25:34 <Exophase>	Yeah, I wonder.
Aug 02 19:29:27 <Lordy>	I wonder what would happen if he actually released his game.
Aug 02 19:29:50 <Exophase>	Assuming he releases the nD, right?
Aug 02 19:29:59 <Exophase>	I think Bob's Game would sell at least a few thousand nDs.
Aug 02 19:30:01 <Lordy>	Assuming he releases it somewhere.
Aug 02 19:30:10 <Exophase>	Even if nD cost a more realistic price like $40+
Aug 02 19:30:50 <Exophase>	If that happens maybe I'll do an nD emulator to spite him ;p
Aug 02 19:31:22 <Lordy>	But I was more wondering like not what would happen to the nD etc. but more his internet fame.
Aug 02 19:31:35 <Lordy>	Would anybody really care anymore?
Aug 02 19:32:20 <--	pandabear41 has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
Aug 02 19:32:37 <Exophase>	I think his internet reception has been more negative than positive, and you hardly need a reptuation for your game to be taken seriously.
Aug 02 19:32:45 <Exophase>	If an indie game is good people will play it, that's all there really is to it.
Aug 02 19:33:16 <Exophase>	But honestly, I think he'd get more attention (positive for a change)
Aug 02 19:33:25 <Exophase>	People still cared after him releasing nothing on Bob's Game for what, a couple years?
Aug 02 19:33:52 <Lordy>	I posted a thread on /v/ after the release of the nD video
Aug 02 19:34:01 <Lordy>	And it was 95% fuck off bob.
Aug 02 19:34:56 <Exophase>	Yeah, I dind't have the balls to look for the nD threads on /v/ while at work ;p
Aug 02 19:35:10 <Exophase>	I know /b/ and /s/ and whatever aren't all of 4chan but I'm not willing to take that chance!
Aug 02 19:35:52 <Lordy>	It's not like anything of value ever gets posted on 4chan anyway. I just think it's a nice demographic.
Aug 02 19:36:13 <Exophase>	I hear the more obscure boards are pretty useful and civil.
Aug 02 19:36:39 <Exophase>	That's part of my theory on internet forum conduct. The more of a point a place has the more agreeable the people there are.
Aug 02 19:36:59 <Exophase>	Or rather, the more everyone wants to talk about a some unifying topic
Aug 02 19:38:01 <Exophase>	I wouldn't post there though, knowing it'll be gone in a few hours at most is kind of depressing.
Aug 02 19:38:06 <Exophase>	Not on /v/ I mean
Aug 02 19:38:08 <Exophase>	Dunno about the others
Aug 02 19:38:18 <Exophase>	Is any nD thread still up>
Aug 02 19:38:18 <Exophase>	?
Aug 02 19:38:34 <Lordy>	I could make one. But I guess nobody would be very interrested
Aug 02 19:40:12 <Exophase>	Yeah I guess not.
Aug 02 19:40:20 <Exophase>	nD forums are dying down too huh
Aug 02 19:40:31 <Lordy>	like the bobsgameforums
Aug 02 19:40:52 <Lordy>	http://boards.4chan.org/v/res/104971529#watch
Aug 02 19:40:53 <Lordy>	here
Aug 02 19:41:27 <Exophase>	Didn't he close the entrance to the bob's game forums?
Aug 02 19:41:31 <Exophase>	Redirecting to the nD's?
Aug 02 19:41:39 <Lordy>	well i meant to use the past tense
Aug 02 19:41:54 <Exophase>	Hm, okay
Aug 02 19:42:11 <Lordy>	I'm no native speaker and it is late :P
Aug 02 19:43:04 <Lordy>	Still 4chan pretty much turned into an awful place in the last
Aug 02 19:43:16 <Lordy>	I don't even remeber how long i was there
Aug 02 19:44:17 <Exophase>	Wow, people respond quickly.
Aug 02 19:44:22 <Exophase>	Real instant gratification huh?
Aug 02 19:45:07 <Lordy>	Well if nobody responded thread would probably be dead in about 5 minutes
Aug 02 19:46:07 <Lordy>	Funny thing is
Aug 02 19:46:25 <Lordy>	Somebody always accuses me of beeing bob
Aug 02 19:46:55 <Exophase>	MAYBE YOU ARE
Aug 02 19:46:56 <Exophase>	gasp
Aug 02 19:47:18 <Lordy>	I really hope I'm not
Aug 02 19:48:03 <Exophase>	That would kind of suck to find out.
Aug 02 19:48:44 <Lordy>	Well , i guess you had alot of dosh.
Aug 02 19:52:47 <Lordy>	I haven't really checked the forums lately. Is there any real interrest in the nd?
Aug 02 19:53:18 <Exophase>	Yeah some.
Aug 02 19:56:50 <Lordy>	But I don't undestand what he tries to get out of it.
Aug 02 19:57:05 <Lordy>	Like the it looks like a toy because it's for children line.
Aug 02 19:57:22 <Lordy>	How would children know of the nD.
Aug 02 19:57:54 <Exophase>	Because he plans to do marketing during children's TV.
Aug 02 19:57:59 <Exophase>	His words.
Aug 02 19:58:01 <Lordy>	How?
Aug 02 19:58:14 <Lordy>	I heard he had enough money to not work.
Aug 02 19:58:22 <Lordy>	But I didn't think he was filthy rich
Aug 02 19:58:24 <Exophase>	He doesn't have money.
Aug 02 19:58:35 <Exophase>	He said if his "prototype" breaks down he'll get donations to buy a new one.
Aug 02 19:58:36 <--	NIN has quit (Quit: NIN)
Aug 02 19:58:50 <Exophase>	Said prototype is probably 100% off the shelf eval board components, if not just one.
Aug 02 19:59:00 <Exophase>	For something relatively low end. Probably not more than a few hundred.
Aug 02 19:59:08 <Exophase>	So either he's broke or he's unwilling to spend his money.
Aug 02 20:00:14 <Exophase>	He plans to pay for this the same way he plans to make millions of these in the first place, by convincing investors with a lot of money to give it to him.
Aug 02 20:01:45 <Lordy>	Well hypothecialy even if he had the money to advertise during dchildrens tv times. His Ad's until now are pretty grimdark and his game is too and even if there were games, why would any sane child like a fucking toy. Everyone above 8 would say that this handheld just looks too cheap and too toylike for them.
Aug 02 20:02:13 <Lordy>	And why would anybody invest in something which is advertised to sell at production cost
Aug 02 20:03:05 <Exophase>	He admits that Bob's Game is not prime child material.
Aug 02 20:03:21 <Exophase>	Bottom line: he says it's for kids because that's what Nintendo says DS's biggest demographic is, 6-12 year olds.
Aug 02 20:03:31 <Exophase>	Of course, that takes into account a lot of Japanese sales and demographics work differently there..
Aug 02 20:03:57 <Exophase>	I don't know why he thinks kids will like it.
Aug 02 20:04:14 <Exophase>	I asked him why and he says they'll think it's cool because it's cheap and anyone can develop for it.
Aug 02 20:04:14 <Lordy>	Whoops thread got deleted.
Aug 02 20:04:37 <Lordy>	and anyone can develop for it. why would a child care about that?
Aug 02 20:04:41 <Exophase>	He doesn't understand that kids don't care who makes the games they play and that being cheap makes something look worse.
Aug 02 20:04:58 <Exophase>	He said he's looking forward to the first millionaire 12 year olds who publish games on nD..
Aug 02 20:05:37 <Exophase>	He also doesn't understand that children who make GOOD games are a total statistical anomaly..
Aug 02 20:05:38 <Exophase>	I'm not sure I can think of a single example really.
Aug 02 20:05:43 <Lordy>	And that is him talking not some crazy persona he created to promote the fucking game again.
Aug 02 20:05:52 <Exophase>	As far as I can tell, yes.
Aug 02 20:06:54 <Exophase>	It's all a little strange actually. He both thinks he's way more talented than he is AND he thinks lots of other people are as talented as he thinks he is.
Aug 02 20:07:37 <Lordy>	But nobody in the age 6-12 would be willing to learn a language to programm their own game.
Aug 02 20:07:43 <Lordy>	even if they did
Aug 02 20:07:47 <Lordy>	and market it on that platform
Aug 02 20:07:55 <Lordy>	It probably would be illegal
Aug 02 20:08:25 <Exophase>	I don't totally agree with that, only from the perspective that I've known a decent number of very young programmers.
Aug 02 20:08:41 <Lordy>	Well ok
Aug 02 20:08:52 <Lordy>	But he tries to gather in the avarage crowd
Aug 02 20:08:53 <Kutaghs>	selling for profit, might be illegal. Making games and giving it out for free might be legal depending on the circumstances etc etc
Aug 02 20:09:05 <Exophase>	But being able to do decent graphics, music, level design, and moreover writing that doesn't look like it came from, well, a 12 year old..
Aug 02 20:09:12 <Kutaghs>	yeah
Aug 02 20:09:15 <Exophase>	It feels like that stuff takes years of raw experience.
Aug 02 20:09:38 <Exophase>	And yeah I was thinking the same thing, a 12 year old can't be a millionaire.
Aug 02 20:09:41 <Exophase>	Not in this country anyway.
Aug 02 20:09:48 <Kutaghs>	in other words: the developers that might be checking the nD forums currently
Aug 02 20:09:51 <Exophase>	The parents would just get the money.
Aug 02 20:09:51 <Lordy>	Not in any countrsy I think.
Aug 02 20:10:02 <Kutaghs>	are the ones that need to develop games for the nD to make it succesful
Aug 02 20:10:25 <Lordy>	Some of the games on the games page actually look decent
Aug 02 20:11:01 <Lordy>	but
Aug 02 20:11:13 <Exophase>	But they're all gonna be ports.
Aug 02 20:11:19 <Exophase>	Except Bob's Game
Aug 02 20:11:27 <Exophase>	Granted, bob says he has "nD Games" working on a bunch of first party games.
Aug 02 20:11:35 <Exophase>	And that nD's revenue will be strictly from nD Games
Aug 02 20:11:36 <Lordy>	And nothing anybody that is his demographic would care for
Aug 02 20:11:41 <Exophase>	Not the 10% from third party stuff.
Aug 02 20:11:49 <Lordy>	BUT
Aug 02 20:12:01 <Exophase>	I asked him why anyone would work for a salary at nD Games instead of organizing as independent third party companies.
Aug 02 20:12:10 <Exophase>	Given how little money is needed to start.
Aug 02 20:12:25 <Lordy>	Where does he get the money for the initial Batch of nD's? Without investors
Aug 02 20:12:30 <Exophase>	And how nD Games is going to be sharing all of its profit with people who spent millions of dollars pushing the hardware out for no profit.
Aug 02 20:12:44 <Exophase>	Lordy; Of course this all hinges on investors.
Aug 02 20:12:51 <Exophase>	He's naive, he doesn't know how the world works.
Aug 02 20:12:57 <Exophase>	I asked him if he had electrical and mechanical designers.
Aug 02 20:13:01 <Exophase>	He said "a little" but then get this
Aug 02 20:13:12 <Exophase>	He said that the investors he signs up with will most likely get him to work with their engineers.
Aug 02 20:13:13 <Exophase>	wtf?
Aug 02 20:13:29 <Kutaghs>	0.o
Aug 02 20:13:39 <Lordy>	I think our conversation made me dumber
Aug 02 20:13:41 <Kutaghs>	that is already excluding a big chunk of potential investors
Aug 02 20:13:43 <Lordy>	by a whole lot
Aug 02 20:13:59 <Lordy>	I just can't undestand how bob could be that deluded
Aug 02 20:14:10 <Exophase>	So basically, he thinks he's going to raise money on nothing more than an idea, an unrealistically presented one that isn't anything special to begin with, just a pipe dream of a stubborn game developer.
Aug 02 20:14:24 <Exophase>	And get others to do all the work except for software
Aug 02 20:14:37 <Exophase>	He's not that much better than those people who join forums saying they have an idea for a game and want people to do all the work for it.
Aug 02 20:14:42 <Kutaghs>	yeah
Aug 02 20:14:43 <Lordy>	But it's the whole bob game thing all over again
Aug 02 20:14:46 <Kutaghs>	=.=
Aug 02 20:14:53 <Lordy>	Hey dudes I've got a great game idea
Aug 02 20:14:58 <Kutaghs>	oh lord..... :p
Aug 02 20:15:00 <Lordy>	No bob we will not publish
Aug 02 20:15:06 <Lordy>	Well then.
Aug 02 20:15:15 <Lordy>	Hey dudes I've got a great console idea
Aug 02 20:15:15 <Exophase>	In the HiB thread he said that had he wanted to, 1/4th of the way through development of Bob's Game he could have gotten investors and hired a team to help develop it.
Aug 02 20:15:19 <Exophase>	And I'm like good god man
Aug 02 20:15:21 <Lordy>	No bob we will not publish.
Aug 02 20:15:25 <Exophase>	He thinks Bob's Game is just so atypical
Aug 02 20:15:33 <Lordy>	What will he do next? His own investment firm?
Aug 02 20:15:34 <Exophase>	Lots of games done by one person are way better than it's looking to be....
Aug 02 20:16:01 <Exophase>	I think there's a good chance he could still get the money, though.
Aug 02 20:16:05 <Exophase>	Look at the Phantom.
Aug 02 20:16:10 <Exophase>	It lost over $62 million.
Aug 02 20:16:15 <Exophase>	That money all came from investors.
Aug 02 20:16:18 <Lordy>	What is a Phantom
Aug 02 20:16:28 <Exophase>	Phantom games console, it was a rebranded PC
Aug 02 20:16:40 <Exophase>	That alleged to come with a digital distribution system.
Aug 02 20:16:43 <Kutaghs>	Exophase, prime example is "Hazard: The Journey of Life"... It looks excellent, it is unique
Aug 02 20:16:46 <Exophase>	Total utter vaporware, was hyped for years.
Aug 02 20:16:56 <Kutaghs>	I'd almost pre-order it, only the dev doesnt want to :p
Aug 02 20:17:27 <Exophase>	The original CEO behind Phantom drove several companies to bankruptcy after charming venture capitalists
Aug 02 20:17:35 <Exophase>	All the while pocketing millions for himself.
Aug 02 20:17:43 <Exophase>	And getting away with it every time..
Aug 02 20:17:56 <Exophase>	For Phantom he actually got investigated as running a pump & dump.
Aug 02 20:18:05 <Lordy>	That probably would be my dream job.
Aug 02 20:18:09 <Exophase>	To their credit, they did eventually release a specialized keyboard setup
Aug 02 20:18:16 <Exophase>	Called a lapboard
Aug 02 20:18:20 <Exophase>	It was years late too.
Aug 02 20:18:27 <Exophase>	But it has actually won a lot of accolades.
Aug 02 20:18:32 <Exophase>	I think they bought it from a third party.
Aug 02 20:18:44 <Exophase>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_%28console%29
Aug 02 20:18:52 <Exophase>	Read HardOCP's expose on it, it's pretty funny.
Aug 02 20:18:59 <Exophase>	It got them sued ;p
Aug 02 20:19:14 <Exophase>	You know a company is full of shit when they respond to allegations by suing you.
Aug 02 20:19:54 <Exophase>	http://www.hardocp.com/article/2004/09/16/inside_infinium_labs_phantom_console < if you're curious
Aug 02 20:20:23 <Exophase>	Actually, read the first one it links to.
Aug 02 20:20:27 <Exophase>	Oh, it's gone :(
Aug 02 20:20:34 <Exophase>	nm, has been moved :e
Aug 02 20:21:41 <Lordy>	Is Tim However still involved in all of this?
Aug 02 20:22:03 <Exophase>	Phantom? Nah he bailed not that long after, hence why he was charged with pump and dump.
Aug 02 20:22:10 <Lordy>	no the nd
Aug 02 20:22:20 <Lordy>	I just rembered him
Aug 02 20:22:24 <Exophase>	Tim who?
Aug 02 20:22:24 <Lordy>	from the videos
Aug 02 20:22:31 <Exophase>	Tim Rogers??
Aug 02 20:22:32 <Lordy>	Actionbutton entertainment guy
Aug 02 20:22:44 <Exophase>	I never saw any affiliation with him and nD
Aug 02 20:22:47 <Lordy>	The one who bob was in japan with
Aug 02 20:22:49 <Exophase>	All I know is he's bob's pal
Aug 02 20:22:55 <Exophase>	But I'm not sure he outright endorses him.
Aug 02 20:23:00 <Exophase>	His stuff, that is
Aug 02 20:24:02 <Lordy>	I am still confused by everything i learned tonight
Aug 02 20:24:18 <Exophase>	See, it's at least interesting!
Aug 02 20:24:23 <Exophase>	nD forums totally dried up today :/
Aug 02 20:24:29 <Exophase>	What a downer
Aug 02 20:24:35 <Lordy>	But is's like
Aug 02 20:24:44 <Lordy>	do we know how old bob is?
Aug 02 20:26:13 <Exophase>	28
Aug 02 20:26:42 <Lordy>	He should grow up then.
Aug 02 20:27:04 <Exophase>	Yeah, maybe.
Aug 02 20:27:18 <Lordy>	Just drop the delusions
Aug 02 20:27:37 <Lordy>	And go work something honest.
Aug 02 20:28:16 <Lordy>	Did he give any reason why he didn't release on Pc though?
Aug 02 20:28:44 <--	Kutaghs has quit (Quit: TTYL)
Aug 02 20:29:59 <Exophase>	Lordy; Yeah, check out that thread I linked to earlier.
Aug 02 20:30:10 <Exophase>	http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=281 < that one
Aug 02 20:34:12 <Lordy>	But many other Indie developers are able to do this stuff he whines about without any problem
Aug 02 20:35:36 <[]J>	wait what
Aug 02 20:35:40 <[]J>	"they sell 10 million a day"
Aug 02 20:35:43 <[]J>	bob loves talking shit :1
Aug 02 20:36:10 <Lordy>	And calling everything you say technical just makes him sound like a dick
Aug 02 20:36:11 <[]J>	he doesn't even say -what- is sold 10 million of a day
Aug 02 20:36:15 <[]J>	it's certainly not the nD
Aug 02 20:37:15 <Lordy>	It just sounds like he thinks his game is so awsome that he needs a own console for it just taht it feels right
Aug 02 20:37:16 <[]J>	Lordy lol from one of his posts he let out that he hardcoded a lot of stuff in his game rather than using scripting :1
Aug 02 20:38:15 <Exophase>	Lordy; Yeah it's technical that taking the same screen dimensions, quadrupling the resolution, then quadrupling the pixels results in the same appearance.
Aug 02 20:38:26 <[]J>	every room has its own source file (with different source files for when changes happen to the room)
Aug 02 20:38:27 <Exophase>	I don't understand the emotional essense of why it's different!
Aug 02 20:39:01 <Lordy>	Bob codes with emotion.
Aug 02 20:39:05 <[]J>	hehe
Aug 02 20:39:24 <Exophase>	Or how I don't understand the keyboard and gamepads aren't the same thing even though I plainly stated I'd never pick a keyboard over a gamepad for a console style game..
Aug 02 20:39:28 <Lordy>	what does an <if feel like
Aug 02 20:39:51 <Lordy>	You just don understand
Aug 02 20:40:16 <Lordy>	Bobs game is like the best thing that has ever happend to mankind
Aug 02 20:40:25 <Lordy>	will have ever been happend?
Aug 02 20:40:30 <Lordy>	something like this
Aug 02 20:40:42 <Exophase>	Of course he'd be understandably irate when everyone is constantly asking him to explain his logic! I mean, I mean, when everyone is constantly ATTACKING HIM
Aug 02 20:41:12 <Lordy>	You're just envoius of his Investors
Aug 02 20:41:14 <Lordy>	ADMIT IT
Aug 02 20:41:34 <Exophase>	I said exactly one personal thing in that thread, that his viewpoint that if I don't agree with him I must oppose the game industry is self-absorbed.
Aug 02 20:41:46 <Exophase>	(which he took to mean me saying that nD is self-absorbed, because I swear to god he doesn't actually read anything I post)
Aug 02 20:41:55 <Exophase>	Just kinda skims it ;p
Aug 02 20:42:05 <Exophase>	He said how many personal things against me in that thread..?
Aug 02 20:42:36 <Exophase>	1) I have no interest in improving the careers of game developers
Aug 02 20:42:44 <Exophase>	2) I am not being beneficial to the nD community
Aug 02 20:42:53 <Exophase>	3) I'm clearly biased
Aug 02 20:43:01 <Exophase>	4) I have little game design background
Aug 02 20:43:11 <Lordy>	You don't know stuff that is beyond technical point of view
Aug 02 20:43:17 <Exophase>	Also I didn't say I'm interested in how it fails, lolz
Aug 02 20:43:22 <Exophase>	I'm sure in bob vision that's how he read it.
Aug 02 20:43:27 <Lordy>	http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=145&pid=1732#pid1732
Aug 02 20:43:31 <Exophase>	5) I don't understand why it's important
Aug 02 20:43:31 <Lordy>	I like this comment
Aug 02 20:43:50 <Lordy>	It just shows how he thinks his game is too good for any publisher
Aug 02 20:44:26 <Exophase>	I did say I don't care about nD
Aug 02 20:44:28 <Exophase>	But why should I?
Aug 02 20:44:30 <Exophase>	He says it's for kids!
Aug 02 20:44:43 <Exophase>	And I did say I don't care about developing on it.
Aug 02 20:44:47 <Exophase>	But that doesn't mean I don't care about game developers
Aug 02 20:45:03 <Exophase>	The reason why I don't care about nD's impact on the game industry is because it WON'T HAVE ONE
Aug 02 20:45:11 <Lordy>	He just reads what he wants too read.
Aug 02 20:45:46 <Exophase>	So many people, aside from bob himself that is, are acting like he deserves all this credit for such a good IDEA
Aug 02 20:45:49 <Exophase>	It's like if I said.
Aug 02 20:45:50 <Lordy>	I still don't undestand why he thought advertesting it as a toy would be a good idea.
Aug 02 20:45:54 <Exophase>	Hey guys, I had this great idea.
Aug 02 20:45:59 <Exophase>	Let's cure HIV!
Aug 02 20:46:07 <Exophase>	Great huh?
Aug 02 20:46:08 <Exophase>	Who cares if it's not realistic?
Aug 02 20:46:25 <Lordy>	That actually is a good idea.
Aug 02 20:46:38 <Lordy>	You deserve credit when the cure is found.
Aug 02 20:46:40 <Exophase>	He thinks it's a good idea because in spite of all the shit he talks about the game industry he's just as manipulative and insidious as he claims they are.
Aug 02 20:46:51 <Exophase>	He sees kids as the biggest market
Aug 02 20:47:01 <Exophase>	I don't know if he wants to make a ton of money but he sure as hell wants popularity.
Aug 02 20:47:39 <Lordy>	Well he got his 5 minutes of fame already
Aug 02 20:47:52 <Exophase>	Yeah gotta love the internet.
Aug 02 20:47:58 <Lordy>	But I think he doesn't really know what excatly children want
Aug 02 20:48:03 <Exophase>	Back in the day you had to actually do something meaningful to get famous.
Aug 02 20:48:19 <Exophase>	These days you can make a retarded youtube video and suddenly be known by 100 million people.
Aug 02 20:48:41 -->	emusan (~chatzilla@synIRC-60D980DD.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) has joined #nD
Aug 02 20:48:42 <Exophase>	I think he got more attention with his marketing bullshit than he would have got had he released the damn game.
Aug 02 20:48:46 <Exophase>	Hey emusan!
Aug 02 20:48:49 <emusan>	hi
Aug 02 20:48:54 <Exophase>	bob bullshit is reaching critical mass
Aug 02 20:48:59 <emusan>	lol

Aug 02 20:49:09 <emusan>	have I missed that much?
Aug 02 20:49:14 <Exophase>	The stench is shutting down industry worldwide.
Aug 02 20:49:20 <Exophase>	Yeah, read. http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=281
Aug 02 20:49:52 <emusan>	lol yeah, I've read through that thread...
Aug 02 20:50:11 <emusan>	I would have responded, but the ban is never ending lol
Aug 02 20:50:46 <Exophase>	He locked it anyway.
Aug 02 20:50:52 <Exophase>	Must have the last word of course.
Aug 02 20:50:53 <emusan>	oh
Aug 02 20:50:59 <emusan>	lol
Aug 02 20:51:01 <emusan>	yup
Aug 02 20:51:02 <Exophase>	He's a child.
Aug 02 20:51:20 <Exophase>	What can I say, good source of lulz
Aug 02 20:51:21 <Lordy>	That's why he makes a child's toy
Aug 02 20:51:21 <emusan>	yar
Aug 02 20:51:28 <Exophase>	Lordy; You've figured it out!
Aug 02 20:51:30 <Exophase>	It's like the movie Big.
Aug 02 20:51:36 <emusan>	lol
Aug 02 20:51:49 <emusan>	lordy, wish I thought of that
Aug 02 20:51:51 <emusan>	lol
Aug 02 20:52:32 <emusan>	exo, I don't know if you saw because he edited the post fast, but his second to last one in that thread was begging you to help him
Aug 02 20:52:33 <Lordy>	He probably never had fun as a kid so he has to relive his childhood. Like Micheal Jackson, but less talented
Aug 02 20:52:34 <emusan>	lol
Aug 02 20:52:51 <Exophase>	That reminds me of the joke my friend made about the 4kids dubbing studio
Aug 02 20:52:59 <Exophase>	"no, you see, it's literally ran by four children."
Aug 02 20:53:12 <Exophase>	emusan; I had not seen that!
Aug 02 20:53:21 <emusan>	it was epic lol
Aug 02 20:53:26 <Exophase>	I'm quite sure that if he's so desperate for ME to help him that is NOT a good sign.
Aug 02 20:53:32 <emusan>	about a paragraph of asking you to help
Aug 02 20:53:36 <Exophase>	I did see in the other thread where I asked him to divulge important information to developers.
Aug 02 20:53:42 <Exophase>	And he said this isn't Pandora 2.
Aug 02 20:53:46 <emusan>	yeah
Aug 02 20:53:47 <Exophase>	And if I wanted to know I had to join his team.
Aug 02 20:53:48 <Exophase>	Uh yeah.. right..
Aug 02 20:54:01 <emusan>	he doesn't even have a "team"
Aug 02 20:54:10 <emusan>	people would have come out and said they were in it
Aug 02 20:54:10 <Exophase>	One wonders
Aug 02 20:54:14 <Exophase>	I agree emusan.
Aug 02 20:54:16 <Lordy>	Maybe he is just lonley :(
Aug 02 20:54:17 <Exophase>	People would be defending this.
Aug 02 20:54:27 <Exophase>	A lot of things he says are inconsistent.
Aug 02 20:54:31 <Exophase>	I think he's just a big fat liar.
Aug 02 20:54:36 <emusan>	I think he is finally realizing that he can't do it on his own lol
Aug 02 20:54:43 <Lordy>	He needs someone to hug him ;-;
Aug 02 20:54:50 <emusan>	that /was/ me
Aug 02 20:54:53 <Exophase>	So he had a whole paragraph asking me to help him?
Aug 02 20:54:55 <emusan>	oh wait
Aug 02 20:54:58 <Exophase>	Remember any more details? ;p
Aug 02 20:55:00 <emusan>	I thought you said bug him lol
Aug 02 20:55:24 <emusan>	it was something along the lines of your technical expertise would be greatly appreciated and that the offer wouldn't last long
Aug 02 20:55:43 <Lordy>	Behind that rebelious shell is a angsty teenanger who just needs some love.
Aug 02 20:55:45 <emusan>	I think he wanted you to make an emulator for it, as he mentioned your work a few times
Aug 02 20:55:49 <Exophase>	Offer won't last long!
Aug 02 20:55:50 <Exophase>	Come on.
Aug 02 20:56:01 <Exophase>	Why in god's name would I want to help something I have no faith in?
Aug 02 20:56:22 <Exophase>	Why would he want an emulator on a children's device meant to make revenue SOLELY off of new first party games?!
Aug 02 20:56:34 <emusan>	not to mention that if you asked at any time he would have to say yes
Aug 02 20:56:36 <emusan>	even now
Aug 02 20:56:45 <Exophase>	.. moreover
Aug 02 20:56:47 <Exophase>	He ALREADY ASKED
Aug 02 20:56:48 <Exophase>	And I said no!
Aug 02 20:56:52 <Exophase>	Why would I change my mind?!
Aug 02 20:56:57 <emusan>	no, he wanted you to make an emulator for it
Aug 02 20:57:00 <Exophase>	Even then he said he'd just ask later.
Aug 02 20:57:04 <emusan>	one that runs on PC's
Aug 02 20:57:05 <emusan>	for developers
Aug 02 20:57:08 <Exophase>	Oh.
Aug 02 20:57:10 <Exophase>	e_e
Aug 02 20:57:14 <Exophase>	He said he'd just use qemu.
Aug 02 20:57:19 <Exophase>	This is just running Linux with SDL
Aug 02 20:57:23 <Exophase>	You don't need a system mode emulator.
Aug 02 20:57:24 <emusan>	lol I don't think he knows how to do it
Aug 02 20:57:27 <Exophase>	He is right to just wrap qemu
Aug 02 20:57:29 <emusan>	or he would have already
Aug 02 20:57:34 <Exophase>	Well he can get one of the bazillion other people who are capable.
Aug 02 20:57:43 <emusan>	probably not lol
Aug 02 20:57:49 <Exophase>	He keeps saying it doesn't matter if you do your games on PC instead of the real thing.
Aug 02 20:57:50 <Exophase>	So who cares?
Aug 02 20:58:33 <emusan>	yeah
Aug 02 20:58:53 <emusan>	I was surprised by the fact that he keeps saying that developing for nD is just as easy as PC
Aug 02 20:58:56 <Exophase>	He ignored my PM so far ;p
Aug 02 20:58:58 <emusan>	and now he says PC is really hard
Aug 02 20:59:04 <emusan>	he's ignored my PM and my email
Aug 02 20:59:09 <emusan>	though the email I understand
Aug 02 20:59:18 <emusan>	it was after I got banned and was incredibly rude
Aug 02 21:02:09 <Lordy>	Well it was nice talking to you guys. I'll be catching some sleep
Aug 02 21:02:20 <emusan>	good night
Aug 02 21:02:29 <Exophase>	G'night
Aug 02 21:02:40 <Lordy>	We shall meet again!
Aug 02 21:02:46 <emusan>	lol
Aug 02 21:03:23 <Lordy>	I meant good night :P
Aug 02 21:07:50 <emusan>	exo, have you posted any of the stuff he's said on other forums?
Aug 02 21:09:35 <Exophase>	I don't think I have verbatim, but I've mentioned some of what he's said on the openpandora boards
Aug 02 21:11:00 <emusan>	he might be referring to something I said in my email then lol
Aug 02 21:11:26 <emusan>	I talked to one of the dev's that was featured in the HiB2 that I kinda know and showed him the HIB thread, and he got pissed
Aug 02 21:11:51 <Exophase>	No surprise there.
Aug 02 21:11:58 <Exophase>	I don't know what bob expects.
Aug 02 21:12:07 <emusan>	And I told Bob that his rudeness did him no good, and that I showed some of the HIB guys the thread
Aug 02 21:12:14 <Exophase>	You say shit on the internet in a public forum and it's for everyone.
Aug 02 21:12:14 <Exophase>	Don't get all pissed that other people see it.
Aug 02 21:12:36 <Exophase>	If you don't like it keep your mouth shut.
Aug 02 21:12:53 <Exophase>	He acts like it's betraying his confidence to distribute what is said completely openly in the first place.

Aug 05 12:33:57 <bobsgame>	we should move this to freenode for chanserv
Aug 05 12:34:01 <MPQC>	We should
Aug 05 12:34:27 <MPQC>	This is now unofficial after all -.-
Aug 05 12:34:44 <bobsgame>	we don't want an official chatroom for several reasons
Aug 05 12:34:51 <MPQC>	Such as
Aug 05 12:35:08 <bobsgame>	it's a liability and it will get flooded
Aug 05 12:35:20 <MPQC>	I see neither happening in this channel
Aug 05 12:35:21 <bobsgame>	we would have to close it down and piss a lot more people off later
Aug 05 12:35:41 <bobsgame>	just because you don't see something now doesn't mean it won't happen later
Aug 05 12:35:54 <bobsgame>	plus if you guys are watching the pot the water will never boil
Aug 05 12:35:56 <MPQC>	And it will happen because you say so
Aug 05 12:35:58 <MPQC>	:|
Aug 05 12:36:07 <bobsgame>	and then you sit around criticizing it and saying "it will never happen"
Aug 05 12:36:23 <bobsgame>	now if someone new comes in here, i'll have to repeat everything i just said
Aug 05 12:36:32 <bobsgame>	it isn't a useful form of containing information
Aug 05 12:36:33 <MPQC>	Don't worry, I'll C&P it
Aug 05 12:37:10 <MPQC>	And deleting peoples posts is very useful...Yeah?
Aug 05 12:37:27 <MPQC>	:P
Aug 05 12:37:34 <bobsgame>	it is when they are inflammatory and not beneficial to the project, yes
Aug 05 12:37:46 <MPQC>	Or when they go against your view
Aug 05 12:38:02 <bobsgame>	such as what
Aug 05 12:38:17 <MPQC>	Well I wouldn't have proof since there are none, aye?
Aug 05 12:38:23 <bobsgame>	even so, that is still not beneficial to the project
Aug 05 12:38:36 <MPQC>	:P
Aug 05 12:39:14 <bobsgame>	having a forum for anything other than customer and developer support is pushing it
Aug 05 12:39:36 <MPQC>	Explain
Aug 05 12:40:20 <bobsgame>	this is a serious company with real careers behind it
Aug 05 12:40:38 <bobsgame>	we have a corporate lawyer that already told me to remove the forum and game listing
Aug 05 12:40:40 <MPQC>	>Company implies more then 1 person
Aug 05 12:41:25 <bobsgame>	i've repeatedly said it is not a single person company
Aug 05 12:41:50 <bobsgame>	i have no idea why you somehow are unable to accept that
Aug 05 12:41:58 <MPQC>	Because we're awesome like that :)
Aug 05 12:42:01 <MPQC>	And because you can't ban me here
Aug 05 12:42:06 <MPQC>	Maybe g up there will
Aug 05 12:43:23 <bobsgame>	you're making it very difficult for me to continue caring about defending having a community at all
Aug 05 12:43:41 <MPQC>	I'm glad you associate me with the forums when I'm not there
Aug 05 12:44:00 <bobsgame>	you started the topic, did you not?
Aug 05 12:44:16 <MPQC>	No, I joined and you were talking about it
Aug 05 12:44:40 <bobsgame>	i was saying it to an idle channel.
Aug 05 12:45:00 <MPQC>	Nobody heres really idle, they're all sneaky ninjas
Aug 05 12:45:01 <bobsgame>	and that's the first thing i said
Aug 05 12:46:14 <Treeki>	how hypocritical that an "open indie game platform" does not accept people discussing it
Aug 05 12:46:23 <MPQC>	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aug 05 12:46:23 <Treeki>	even Sony and Gantendo have forums (although the latter is for tech support only)
Aug 05 12:46:38 <MPQC>	Nintendo used to have an awesome forum
Aug 05 12:46:42 <bobsgame>	and they have to heavily police those forums with a staff that we can't afford right now
Aug 05 12:47:05 <MPQC>	You can't afford free volunteers...Damnit all people, we're going down
Aug 05 12:47:36 <Treeki>	yeah, every spare cent needs to go towards the $10 goal :p
Aug 05 12:47:39 <bobsgame>	i'm not even sure we can have free volunteers, i've already informed the mods we might have to put them on the payroll
Aug 05 12:47:41 <MPQC>	Indeed lol
Aug 05 12:48:34 <bobsgame>	i'm sure that you guys do actually understand how a business works to some extent
Aug 05 12:48:52 <MPQC>	And that's the part where you come in.....
Aug 05 12:53:30 <MPQC>	I think we lost him :(
Aug 05 12:53:37 <bobsgame>	no
Aug 05 12:53:43 <bobsgame>	i was waiting for the second half of that sentence
Aug 05 12:54:00 <MPQC>	There is no second half
Aug 05 12:54:22 <bobsgame>	i'm pretty sure that there is nothing i can say that you won't just laugh at or use against me, and it makes it impossible to say anything to you.
Aug 05 12:54:57 <MPQC>	Isn't that where the saying "pics or didn't happen" came from?
Aug 05 12:55:03 <bobsgame>	it's a fairly common personality trait and i think you'll find that it results in a lot of people ignoring you.
Aug 05 12:55:33 <MPQC>	I haven't been ignored yet, probably will from you though ._.
Aug 05 12:55:40 <bobsgame>	the world doesn't work like 4chan.
Aug 05 12:55:49 <MPQC>	Never been to 4chan
Aug 05 12:56:02 <MPQC>	Besides random links which are retarded to open
Aug 05 12:56:10 <Treeki>	I just don't understand why you are going to take down the forum and game listing, when one of your main business goals is to attract indie developers and those two things are geared towards them
Aug 05 12:56:37 <MPQC>	Because his lawyer says so
Aug 05 12:56:38 <bobsgame>	i already said why, and you don't understand it.
Aug 05 12:56:55 <bobsgame>	so i can't explain it to you because you refuse accept what i say.
Aug 05 12:57:24 <MPQC>	Explain it to him, and I can be the one to not understand :)
Aug 05 12:57:26 <Treeki>	you've said why you don't want a chatroom, but not why you don't want a forum
Aug 05 12:57:36 <Treeki>	other than "we can't afford moderators"
Aug 05 12:57:38 <bobsgame>	i already said that i've defended the forum several times.
Aug 05 12:58:05 <bobsgame>	you aren't properly understanding what i'm saying to you, you don't seem to want to try to.
Aug 05 12:58:38 <bobsgame>	you're young and it's hard to communicate with you.
Aug 05 12:59:10 <Treeki>	yeah, sure, corporate lawyers and all that
Aug 05 12:59:16 <bobsgame>	see?
Aug 05 12:59:26 <bobsgame>	i tell you the truth and you attack it and refuse to accept it.
Aug 05 12:59:39 <bobsgame>	you are choosing to make it impossible for you to understand.
Aug 05 13:00:02 <MPQC>	Lawyer says take down your main method of attracting any people at all
Aug 05 13:00:04 <MPQC>	Let's do it!
Aug 05 13:00:11 <bobsgame>	see?
Aug 05 13:00:14 <MPQC>	:P
Aug 05 13:00:22 <bobsgame>	that's a huge assumption and it's a very naive stance.
Aug 05 13:00:30 <MPQC>	No, it's all you've told us
Aug 05 13:00:40 <bobsgame>	you're interpreting it that way.
Aug 05 13:00:48 <MPQC>	Then change my mind
Aug 05 13:01:09 <bobsgame>	change MY mind. explain to me exactly why a forum is our main method of attracting "people."
Aug 05 13:01:19 <bobsgame>	attracting people for what?
Aug 05 13:01:24 <bobsgame>	attracting whom?
Aug 05 13:01:27 <bobsgame>	how is it attracting them?
Aug 05 13:01:39 <MPQC>	Tell me this
Aug 05 13:01:43 <bobsgame>	no, you tell me.
Aug 05 13:01:44 <MPQC>	You google a product and find no info on it
Aug 05 13:01:47 <MPQC>	Will you buy it?
Aug 05 13:01:58 <bobsgame>	answer me questions.
Aug 05 13:02:16 <pandabear41>	I would, if it looked cool and i have in the past.
Aug 05 13:02:24 <MPQC>	lol
Aug 05 13:02:36 <Treeki>	as an indie developer: who would you rather stake your game on: a game console with nothing to prove but hype they've written, or a game console with an active community (customers who will play your game and developers who will provide support)?
Aug 05 13:02:39 <bobsgame>	i usually buy things from the store and from amazon without looking at their website.
Aug 05 13:03:06 <bobsgame>	as an indie developer i will develop for whichever platform has the largest market.
Aug 05 13:03:13 <bobsgame>	with the demographic for my game.
Aug 05 13:03:23 <MPQC>	So pretty much, the one with the active community :P
Aug 05 13:03:26 <bobsgame>	no.
Aug 05 13:03:45 <MPQC>	Your game doesn't even fit your demographic
Aug 05 13:03:47 <MPQC>	~Confused~
Aug 05 13:03:47 <bobsgame>	for whichever platform has the largest market with the demographic for my game.
Aug 05 13:04:31 <bobsgame>	that could be the playstation 4 or the leapster for all i care.
Aug 05 13:04:58 <bobsgame>	answer my questions.
Aug 05 13:05:27 <bobsgame>	without jumping to sarcasm or using any other ego defense mechanism.
Aug 05 13:05:54 <MPQC>	We all wouldn't be here without the forum so I think it's pretty clear
Aug 05 13:06:32 <bobsgame>	you are not the market nor are you a developer.
Aug 05 13:06:38 <bobsgame>	it isn't clear.
Aug 05 13:06:59 <MPQC>	So I'm not going to buy it since you say so...
Aug 05 13:07:07 <bobsgame>	all the forum seems to do is attract negative attention and angry kids with chips on their shoulders.
Aug 05 13:07:26 <bobsgame>	why should i keep it?
Aug 05 13:07:35 <bobsgame>	you are not the market.
Aug 05 13:08:03 <bobsgame>	in fact, you're past the age where you should be playing with kids toys and you should be focusing on schoolwork and your career.
Aug 05 13:08:17 <MPQC>	Sorry for slacking
Aug 05 13:08:26 <MPQC>	Never too old to game
Aug 05 13:08:37 <MPQC>	My grandma still plays solitare, got nothing on me
Aug 05 13:08:39 <bobsgame>	it doesn't bother me in the slightest.
Aug 05 13:08:43 <MPQC>	:P
Aug 05 13:08:55 <bobsgame>	i have no reason to care where your life ends up.
Aug 05 13:09:32 <bobsgame>	solitaire is generally not considered a toy for kids.
Aug 05 13:10:07 <bobsgame>	also, that's a deflection technique, and it violates the conversation rule i stated.
Aug 05 13:10:19 <MPQC>	And what conversation rule is this?
Aug 05 13:10:35 <bobsgame>	answer without sarcasm or any other ego defense mechanism.
Aug 05 13:10:36 <MPQC>	My grandma is apart of my ego?
Aug 05 13:11:16 <bobsgame>	you changed the subject from yourself and used her as an example to defend your behavior.
Aug 05 13:11:22 <bobsgame>	you are not your grandma.
Aug 05 13:11:40 <MPQC>	Would you have rather I used yourself as an example?
Aug 05 13:12:11 <bobsgame>	no, don't use a another person as an example to defend or justify yourself.
Aug 05 13:12:42 <bobsgame>	answer my questions, please.
Aug 05 13:12:44 <MPQC>	So I'm only allowed to talk about myself, that seems a bit egotistical don't you think
Aug 05 13:13:02 <bobsgame>	no, it doesn't.
Aug 05 13:13:28 <bobsgame>	that seems like it would be threatening to your ego, so you would naturally jump to defense mechanism techniques to protect it.
Aug 05 13:15:53 <bobsgame>	your tendency to do this is likely obvious to most people, and they will become frustrated with dealing with you and give up or ignore you.
Aug 05 13:16:24 <MPQC>	Any normal person defends themself
Aug 05 13:16:48 <bobsgame>	most people do, some people do it more than others.
Aug 05 13:17:17 <MPQC>	Constantly being insulted doesn't help ;)
Aug 05 13:17:21 <bobsgame>	you're clearly a smart kid
Aug 05 13:17:41 <MPQC>	I'm going to talk in rainbows from now on
Aug 05 13:17:46 <bobsgame>	"too smart for his own good" is probably what people say.
Aug 05 13:17:58 <MPQC>	Can't say I've ever heard that one
Aug 05 13:18:11 <bobsgame>	they wouldn't say it to you.
Aug 05 13:18:20 <JosJuice>	You aren't going to attract your demographic (kids) with a forum, but developers will most likely be interested to see something more than just a webpage. They'll be able to see what kinds of things are possible on the nD based on what others are doing. They'll be able to ask questions. If you don't have a decent amount of developers, there won't be many games to buy. There are probably other methods of attracting developers, but I don't see wh
Aug 05 13:18:34 <JosJuice>	(Sorry if that message got cut off.)
Aug 05 13:19:00 <bobsgame>	right, as i said, the only reason for having a forum is for customer and developer support.
Aug 05 13:19:02 <bobsgame>	anything else is pushing it.
Aug 05 13:19:20 <bobsgame>	regardless, i've been defending the forum.
Aug 05 13:20:13 <MPQC>	You won't have any developers to support if they see nothing...
Aug 05 13:20:31 <JosJuice>	So does this mean that there will be a forum, even if only for customer and developer support? Or has nothing been decided yet?
Aug 05 13:20:33 <bobsgame>	there is a wiki.
Aug 05 13:20:51 <MPQC>	A very useful one, it gives you an installer :)
Aug 05 13:21:11 <bobsgame>	yes, and it will become populated with examples.
Aug 05 13:21:15 <bobsgame>	that's really all we need.
Aug 05 13:21:36 <bobsgame>	developers don't care whether there is a forum or not, they are busy developing games.
Aug 05 13:21:51 <bobsgame>	all they would use it for is for finding information and asking for help.
Aug 05 13:22:46 <JosJuice>	Yes. Are you planning to use the wiki for that? They aren't ideal for asking for help and other kinds of discussion.
Aug 05 13:23:10 <bobsgame>	wiki talk pages work fine for that purpose, but i'm keeping the forum for development questions because it is a bit more convenient.
Aug 05 13:23:11 <MPQC>	Wait...If this is an open handheld...The developers ARE the community
Aug 05 13:24:05 <bobsgame>	right, so anyone not developing a game for the nD should be disallowed from participating?
Aug 05 13:24:19 <bobsgame>	that makes things easier for me.
Aug 05 13:25:00 <bobsgame>	are we all in agreement there?
Aug 05 13:25:40 <JosJuice>	Disallowed from participating in what? Discussion about development? General discussion about the nD? The wiki?
Aug 05 13:25:59 <MPQC>	Talking
Aug 05 13:26:00 <bobsgame>	we'll have a section for registered developers with pledged games only.
Aug 05 13:26:10 <bobsgame>	for strictly development Q&A
Aug 05 13:26:26 <bobsgame>	and we'll shut down the rest
Aug 05 13:27:01 <MPQC>	Hi I'm Bab and I have a question, what games are on the nD?
Aug 05 13:27:24 <MPQC>	Oh, the list was taken away? Too bad
Aug 05 13:27:30 <bobsgame>	i'm putting you on ignore.
Aug 05 13:27:39 <MPQC>	Aw :(
Aug 05 13:27:52 <MPQC>	I'm too ignorant :P
Aug 05 13:28:47 <JosJuice>	Will the development tools still be available from the wiki (or some other source) for everyone?
Aug 05 13:29:03 <bobsgame>	yes
Aug 05 13:29:13 <JosJuice>	That sounds fair.
Aug 05 13:29:15 <bobsgame>	i'm also going to continue defending my decision to keep the forum open
Aug 05 13:30:00 <bobsgame>	because i also think having a community of enthusiasts is beneficial to the project as a whole, though it is negative from a business standpoint.
Aug 05 13:30:29 <MPQC>	Wonder what Exo would say about that
Aug 05 13:30:49 <bobsgame>	as the CEO i am still able to make that decision, but i won't be CEO for much longer and it won't be up to me.
Aug 05 13:33:33 <bobsgame>	i hope that was informative enough for any of the serious developers here.
Aug 05 13:33:47 <MPQC>	Though I'm probably still on ignore, can I port Tetrid over to the DS?
Aug 05 13:33:55 <--	bobsgame has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Aug 05 13:34:11 <MPQC>	That was fun
Aug 05 13:34:40 <JosJuice>	I wonder if there really is a company.
Aug 05 13:34:49 <JosJuice>	He doesn't seem to be willing to tell us much about it.
Aug 05 13:36:06 <MPQC>	He can't afford a good host, it makes me doubt whether there is a lawyer
Aug 05 13:36:08 <MPQC>	Or a company
Aug 05 13:36:15 <MPQC>	Or a new CEO
Aug 05 13:36:21 <MPQC>	Why's he not the president?
Aug 05 13:37:31 <user82>	MPQC, you started the rainbow machine?
Aug 05 13:37:49 <MPQC>	It is quite awesome

Aug 05 13:39:53 <user82>	dont want to read that stuff though
Aug 05 13:39:58 <MPQC>	Not worth reading
Aug 05 13:40:25 <user82>	i figured :P
Aug 05 13:40:38 <MPQC>	If I put Tetrid in my Tetris collection do you think he'll care? :)

Aug 05 16:21:26 <emusan>	he said he will work with the creators of emulators to try and package them with homebrew for the emulated consoles
Aug 05 16:21:37 <emusan>	that and try and get licenses from the original publishers
Aug 05 16:22:06 <emusan>	of course a custom firmware would maybe to it, but that's a more work than it should be

Aug 05 16:45:18 <emusan>	emulation is not illegal though
Aug 05 16:45:28 <emusan>	he thinks he'll get the licenses from the original publishers
Aug 05 16:45:37 <emusan>	but 90% of those publishers are nintendo
Aug 05 16:45:59 <emusan>	and nintendo and Bob don't exactly have the best history
Aug 05 16:46:35 <pandabear41>	They don't give a fuck anyways, the emulator designer's that is. Nintendo, now that is a different story.

Aug 15 18:25:35 <Treeki>	not me
Aug 15 18:26:24 <pandabear41>	They are fucking shit.
Aug 15 18:28:13 <Kutagh>	they provide a good service IMO
Aug 15 18:28:27 <Kutagh>	what is so shit about them according to you?
Aug 15 18:28:44 <pandabear41>	Hold on I am typing up my situation.
Aug 15 18:30:08 <pandabear41>	I purchased a game about a month ago and it did not work on my computer, it crashed every time. I submitted a ticket a while ago saying hey this game is broken I would like a refund. They said NO. I tried to submit another ticket because the old one closed by the rep and the new ticket was immediately closed by them. I tried a few more times and same thing.
Aug 15 18:30:32 <pandabear41>	I then contacted the BBB with a very unspecific complaint.
Aug 15 18:30:56 <pandabear41>	I purchased some software from this company a few weeks ago. When I installed and played it, the software would not function at all. Since the product can't be repaired or fixed (since they refuse to do so), they should provide a refund or and exchange of an equivalent product. They say they won't exchange it for an equivalent product or give me a refund at a
Aug 15 18:30:57 <pandabear41>	ll
Aug 15 18:31:11 <pandabear41>	They responded with 
Aug 15 18:31:29 <pandabear41>	The purchase made was not made through Steam, Steam support does not have access to the purchase or purchase information made through a different company. Steam support provides support for issues with Steam and Valve games, the publisher of other games provides support for their titles. The consumer will need to contact the correct department for assistance 
Aug 15 18:31:59 <pandabear41>	I responded with
Aug 15 18:32:22 <pandabear41>	"The purchase made was not made through Steam, Steam support does not have access to the purchase or purchase information made through a different company.", The payment did go through you!! It was not through another company. Let me look at my credit card statement. "Credit Card Purchase 25JUL2011 VALVE SOFTWARE 425-8899642 WA	-$29.99" hmm,
Aug 15 18:32:26 <pandabear41>	 If that does not look like a purchase through you there must be some major problems with your accounting and records staff. It should be your job to satisfy the customer
Aug 15 18:34:18 <pandabear41>	All I can say if fuck them.
Aug 15 18:34:22 <Kutagh>	which game was it?
Aug 15 18:34:53 <pandabear41>	They sent me an email today saying if I disputed the charge with my credit card company, the will disable my account.
Aug 15 18:35:02 <Treeki>	I'm a little surprised, Valve is usually known for good customer services
Aug 15 18:35:04 <Treeki>	service*
Aug 15 18:35:10 <Kutagh>	standard policy for chargebacks
Aug 15 18:35:36 <pandabear41>	No their policy has a loophole that make them not obligated to give refunds.
Aug 15 18:35:39 <Kutagh>	It is IMO a bit over the top, disabling the whole account
Aug 15 18:36:25 <Kutagh>	I dont see what the policy of chargebacks has to do with refunds
Aug 15 18:37:01 <pandabear41>	No that they won;t give me a refund in the first place not chargebacks.
Aug 15 18:37:02 <Kutagh>	it is mainly for one thing: People buying a game on Steam and then use a chargeback so they get the game for 'free'
Aug 15 18:37:09 <pandabear41>	I am not talking about chargebacks
Aug 15 18:37:11 <Kutagh>	heh
Aug 15 18:37:13 <Kutagh>	anyway
Aug 15 18:37:15 <Kutagh>	which game?
Aug 15 18:37:23 <pandabear41>	I want a fucking refund for a broken game.
Aug 15 18:37:41 <Kutagh>	pandabear41, which game is the issue?
Aug 15 18:38:23 <pandabear41>	Look at their policy, those sly bastards string it out in the way that they won't allow refunds for defective products.
Aug 15 18:38:43 *	Kutagh sighs
Aug 15 18:38:52 <pandabear41>	 You will have a period of thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of any Merchandise to examine the Merchandise to confirm that it conforms to this Agreement and the offer for such Merchandise presented to you at Steam. If the Merchandise does not conform to this Agreement and the offer for such Merchandise presented to you via Steam, you may reject the M
Aug 15 18:38:53 <Kutagh>	hello, I am asking you which game aint working for you
Aug 15 18:39:11 <pandabear41>	"conforms to this Agreement" is the key.
Aug 15 18:39:24 <pandabear41>	Then down later it says "VALVE DOES NOT GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE OR SECURE OPERATION AND ACCESS TO STEAM, THE SOFTWARE, YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS(S)."
Aug 15 18:39:30 <Kutagh>	merchandise != software
Aug 15 18:39:38 <Kutagh>	Valve may from time to time offer items other than software, content and services for purchase via Steam (e.g., apparel, books, posters, etc.) ("Merchandise")
Aug 15 18:43:16 <pandabear41>	merchandise == software. lol
Aug 15 18:44:04 <Kutagh>	in that Steam Subscriber Agreement it is not
Aug 15 18:44:34 <Kutagh>	it clearly says in the quote
Aug 15 18:44:53 <pandabear41>	In economics, it is!
Aug 15 18:44:57 <Kutagh>	Merchandise = physical items that are mailed to you
Aug 15 18:45:11 <Kutagh>	Hello, this is not economics. This is laws.
Aug 15 18:45:45 <Kutagh>	Valve has clearly described what can be understood as merchandise in the SSA.
Aug 15 18:46:09 <Kutagh>	in this case, physical items that are shipped to customers, not the software offered.
Aug 15 18:46:36 <Kutagh>	Feel free to ask a lawyer about this but they'll say the same
Aug 15 18:46:45 <pandabear41>	Then in the fucking law merchandise == software.

Aug 15 18:46:54 <Kutagh>	fuck it
Aug 15 18:47:01 <Kutagh>	you dont answer the question about which game it is

Aug 17 19:58:47 <Exophase>	Wow.. did you guys see this? "Javascript is C syntax. Java is a subset of C++. C# was originally an implementation of Java which was renamed due to a lawsuit IIRC, and it was packaged with a Java->C# source converter. ActionScript is very close to Java/C#."
Aug 17 19:59:13 <Exophase>	I'm genuinely surprised that bob is this ignorant about programming languages.
Aug 17 20:09:23 <Stryker001>	it's no wonder the nD is just a Dream

Aug 17 20:10:35 <[]J>	Exophase I'm not so surprised after he let out awhile back that he hardcoded all the rooms in his game
Aug 17 20:10:40 <[]J>	rather than using scripting
Aug 17 20:10:50 <[]J>	probably why his game took so many years :1
Aug 17 20:11:21 <Stryker001>	yeah
Aug 17 20:11:42 <Stryker001>	it's great to be able to code a few things like that
Aug 17 20:11:49 <Stryker001>	but not once you hit more than a few
Aug 17 20:11:52 <Stryker001>	:(
Aug 17 20:11:57 <Stryker001>	that's just a waste of tim
Aug 17 20:12:00 <Stryker001>	*time
Aug 17 20:12:07 <Stryker001>	Poor, poor, Tim
Aug 17 20:12:12 <Stryker001>	he gets wasted all the time
Aug 17 20:12:14 <[]J>	hehe
Aug 17 20:12:15 <Stryker001>	LD
Aug 17 20:16:03 <Exophase>	It's clear he never actually learned a programming language outside of C, he should stop pretending he knows anything about other languages..
Aug 17 20:17:15 <Stryker001>	so what's gonna happen to this chatroom channel and Bob's forum when everyone realizes the nD is a no=go?
Aug 17 20:17:29 <Exophase>	I think it'll take years for people to really lose hope.
Aug 17 20:17:40 <Stryker001>	aww
Aug 17 20:18:09 <Stryker001>	Not sure if optimistic... or pessimistic 
Aug 17 20:18:17 <Exophase>	Hard-coding the room stuff doesn't necessarily seem that bad, I can see how including a scripting language can be a PITA
Aug 17 20:18:34 <Exophase>	But if you did that you'd at least want to have your own library for it..
Aug 17 20:18:45 <Exophase>	And probably as much meta-language as your language can give you.
Aug 17 20:19:04 <Exophase>	Most of us would probably get sick of it pretty quickly still..
Aug 17 20:20:21 <Exophase>	I wonder what they did for old NES and SNES RPGs
Aug 17 20:20:42 <Stryker001>	scripting + parameters?
Aug 17 20:20:57 <Stryker001>	i doubt they would hve programmed everything fro scratch
Aug 17 20:20:57 <Exophase>	I doubt they used scripting languages on games where they barely had compilers for the games themselves.
Aug 17 20:21:28 <Stryker001>	that's true
Aug 17 20:21:35 <Exophase>	But it was probably still abstracted in some way..
Aug 17 20:21:45 <Stryker001>	(you can tell I haven't been doing this for long...)
Aug 17 20:22:04 <Exophase>	I mean, you have NPCs that have simple moving patterns and will say certain things when you talk to them. So they're represented by some simple data structure that defines how they move and what they say.
Aug 17 20:22:20 <Exophase>	Then you have ones that go to cutscenes when you talk to them if whatever flags are true.
Aug 17 20:23:02 <Exophase>	Stuff in Bob's Game is slightly more complex than that..
Aug 17 20:23:57 <Exophase>	But it's still hard to imagine him not abstracting out the text to data files and the basic behavior to data structures in some static arrays or something..
Aug 17 20:24:05 <Exophase>	So I don't know what there is to hard code really..
Aug 17 20:24:45 <Stryker001>	*yawn*

Aug 18 20:54:57 <emusan>	I loled a bit
Aug 18 20:55:10 <emusan>	but I did learn basic Java stuff quickly with C++
Aug 18 20:55:18 <emusan>	but I wouldn't say I'm an expert in either

Aug 18 20:55:26 <Exophase>	Anyone who thinks programming languages are about syntax doesn't understand programming.
Aug 18 20:55:34 <emusan>	but knowing any programming languages makes others easier to get into
Aug 18 20:55:42 <Exophase>	Sure, I'm not saying Java is harder than C++ or anything like that.
Aug 18 20:55:45 <emusan>	yeah
Aug 18 20:55:47 <Exophase>	Just that there's a lot to both of them.
Aug 18 20:56:03 <emusan>	it's just like comparing German with English...

Aug 24 20:24:09 <Exophase>	pandabear41; Yeah I PMed him about it.
Aug 24 20:25:12 <Exophase>	I guess Steve Jobs doesn't have much time left :/
Aug 24 20:25:34 <Exophase>	I'm sure if he were at all capable of continuing he would..
Aug 24 20:26:08 <Exophase>	Turn a company from failing to the wealthiest on the planet, with no sign of slowing down.. hard to want a CEO like that to step down.
Aug 24 20:26:46 <pandabear41>	Well he banned both me and emusan.
Aug 24 20:26:49 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 24 20:27:27 <pandabear41>	Didn't Steve Jobs have a stroke anyways. I remember hearing something like that.
Aug 24 20:27:31 <Exophase>	No surprise there.
Aug 24 20:27:43 <Exophase>	Yeah something like that, he had a major health problem.
Aug 24 20:29:35 <pandabear41>	I should switch the off switch on bob's site again. 
Aug 24 20:30:29 <Exophase>	Shit, he's only 56..
Aug 24 20:30:32 <Exophase>	I thought he was much older than that..
Aug 24 20:30:49 <Exophase>	That sucks :/
Aug 24 20:30:52 <pandabear41>	I thought he was in his late 60's 
Aug 24 20:31:07 <Exophase>	Same, figured mid to late 60s. I mean, he was in the industry since when, the late 70s?
Aug 24 20:31:49 <pandabear41>	Oh he had cancer, that was what happened.
Aug 24 20:32:29 <Exophase>	Interestingly, he's not really that wealthy. I mean, compared to Apple's wealth..
Aug 24 20:32:54 <pandabear41>	Yea, but I think he did not want to be like bill gates.
Aug 24 20:33:11 <Exophase>	He's worth a lot of money but you'd expect the CEO of the richest company in America to be in the top 10 richest people in America
Aug 24 20:33:12 <pandabear41>	Look at gates he is a complete ass hole
Aug 24 20:33:14 <Exophase>	If not top 5
Aug 24 20:33:29 <Exophase>	pandabear41; Maybe, but at least Gates gave a lot to charities, Jobs doesn't give anything..
Aug 24 20:33:54 <Exophase>	Plus Jobs has done some really shady things, like when he backstabbed Wozniak..
Aug 24 20:34:01 <pandabear41>	That has been recent tho. Back in the day gates was very different.
Aug 24 20:34:08 <Exophase>	And in general he's said to not be very well liked.
Aug 24 20:34:19 <Exophase>	Although maybe things changed as he got older.
Aug 24 20:34:24 <pandabear41>	I guess so.
Aug 24 20:35:14 <pandabear41>	He probably changed, that is why he has been giving his fortune to tons of organizations and chers.
Aug 24 20:35:47 <[]J>	donk

Aug 24 22:30:38 <[]J>	blocked for me too
Aug 24 22:31:01 <pandabear41>	gBev, wake up tell us what is on that page.
Aug 24 22:31:11 <gBev>	hi
Aug 24 22:31:15 <gBev>	?
Aug 24 22:31:25 <pandabear41>	What did bob put on here http://the-nd.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=334
Aug 24 22:31:49 <gBev>	i probably shouldn't tell, but i don't care, hold on i'll screenshot the page
Aug 24 22:32:36 <gBev>	http://i.imgur.com/9jV4Z.jpg
Aug 24 22:32:50 <gBev>	it got doubled in the beginning for a couple posts, the rest is fine
Aug 24 22:33:49 <pandabear41>	Ok, he does not have any threat plans in the trash bin or anything like that anywhere?
Aug 24 22:34:11 <gBev>	threat plans?
Aug 24 22:34:34 <gBev>	there's nothing there, the next oldest post is me arguing with him about IRC weeks ago and there's nothing newer
Aug 24 22:34:38 <pandabear41>	Well he threatened me today with some things I should probably not speak of publicly. 
Aug 24 22:35:07 <gBev>	he.. threatened you
Aug 24 22:35:08 <gBev>	?
Aug 24 22:35:41 <pandabear41>	Yah during that whole thing.
Aug 24 22:36:16 <pandabear41>	Becase I leaked a chat log of him saying that I am a psyco and stuff like that.
Aug 24 22:37:24 <gBev>	what O_o
Aug 24 22:37:27 <gBev>	link?
Aug 24 22:37:48 <pandabear41>	This http://pastebin.com/34dptATp
Aug 24 22:39:24 <gBev>	what could he say in those logs that could be so bad
Aug 24 22:40:24 <pandabear41>	He has quite a bit of personal attacks to various developers, me, and emusan and some other forum members.
Aug 24 22:40:49 <pandabear41>	That is why he is saying "it might hurt some feelings or something" :P
Aug 24 22:42:25 <pandabear41>	You can read the thread that he moved for the rest of crap that was during all of the stuff he said in the pastebin.
Aug 24 22:45:11 <pandabear41>	And he just removed the last half of the post where emusan said some stuff about the chat log. And then bob blew up and banned me and him, locked down registrations, and a bunch of other things.

Aug 24 23:02:32 <[]J>	2c wat
Aug 24 23:02:37 <pandabear41>	2 cents.
Aug 24 23:02:51 <pandabear41>	It's slang. :P
Aug 24 23:03:53 <[]J>	righto
Aug 24 23:04:05 <[]J>	I know 2 cents, never seen it shortened like that is all
Aug 24 23:04:29 <pandabear41>	oh
Aug 24 23:05:05 <[]J>	I wonder what kind of insane things bob would be doing if he just released at the peak of his popularity
Aug 24 23:05:10 <[]J>	and made bank
Aug 24 23:05:53 <pandabear41>	huh?
Aug 24 23:05:57 <[]J>	blowing his money on frivolous court cases over internet-slights, probably
Aug 24 23:06:01 *	[]J just talking nonsense
Aug 24 23:06:40 <pandabear41>	He is broke. Barely has a place to live. :P
Aug 24 23:10:31 <[]J>	yes but I said "if" :1
Aug 24 23:10:41 <[]J>	I guessed he was probably in a sorry state now
Aug 24 23:10:45 <pandabear41>	:P He would.
Aug 24 23:11:54 <pandabear41>	Well he dug his own hole, he hasn't earned a any money since 2002, because he though that bobs game is the best in the whole world.
Aug 24 23:13:25 <[]J>	lmao
Aug 24 23:14:26 <[]J>	he sure got a lot of publicity though, maybe I should pretend to be insane to spread my game's name :/
Aug 24 23:14:51 <pandabear41>	Yah, but don't make the same mistakes as he did.
Aug 24 23:14:59 <pandabear41>	I would not recommend it.
Aug 24 23:15:02 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 24 23:15:06 <[]J>	specifically?
Aug 24 23:15:11 <[]J>	not actually releasing or what
Aug 24 23:15:42 <pandabear41>	Yah where he said that bobs game would come out on xx/xx/xx date and then only release a demo.
Aug 24 23:16:30 <pandabear41>	He is always rude and a jerk to the community, treating almost all of them an enemys, like they are out there to ruin him.
Aug 24 23:17:10 <pandabear41>	shit spelling *enemies
Aug 24 23:17:59 <[]J>	no publicity is bad publicity!
Aug 24 23:18:34 <[]J>	a: bob sure is a jerk
Aug 24 23:18:43 <[]J>	b: bob who? lemme check this game out it looks neat *buy*
Aug 24 23:18:45 <[]J>	later
Aug 24 23:18:50 <[]J>	b: man fuck bob he's such a jerk
Aug 24 23:18:55 <pandabear41>	Look at Rebecka Black and then say that again with a straight face. No one will ever like her because of that one song.
Aug 24 23:19:01 <[]J>	c: bob who? lemme check this game out it looks neat *buy*
Aug 24 23:19:02 <[]J>	:v
Aug 24 23:19:06 <pandabear41>	Bob is the kinda the same way
Aug 24 23:19:13 <[]J>	hahaha
Aug 24 23:19:21 <[]J>	dat song
Aug 24 23:19:37 <[]J>	do kids feel the same way? I mean she is a kid and it's meant for kids
Aug 24 23:19:44 <[]J>	they might not see the vapidity of it
Aug 24 23:19:46 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 24 23:21:05 <pandabear41>	Have you seen her new song?
Aug 24 23:21:14 <pandabear41>	heard not seen

Aug 24 23:42:11 <Exophase>	I don't really get the point of all the viral marketing behind bob's game.
Aug 24 23:42:22 <Exophase>	bob has said it was extremely successful but how exactly is he measuring this?
Aug 24 23:42:28 <Exophase>	If you don't have a game to sell what difference does it make?
Aug 24 23:42:48 <Exophase>	Something like Cave Story was highly successful, surely a good indie game doesn't need weird advertising for word to spread.
Aug 24 23:43:59 <Exophase>	Game authors are not idols or something, it's pointless for them to gain personal popularity..
Aug 24 23:44:30 <Exophase>	Look at some of the most popular serieses like Gears of War, do people at large even know which individuals made it? I doubt it.
Aug 24 23:44:54 <Exophase>	And again something like Cave Story, yeah people know some guy named Pixel made it, but beyond that he has almost no web personality.
Aug 24 23:45:10 <Exophase>	And again for the makers of World of Goo, Super Meat Boy, etc etc
Aug 24 23:48:15 <Exophase>	Maybe bob should have gone into a career in marketing..
Aug 24 23:48:28 <Exophase>	Not that he's actually good at it, but that's clearly what he's interested in.
Aug 24 23:49:10 <--	Syniphas has quit (Quit: )
Aug 24 23:49:13 <pandabear41>	The only game that I know of that used viral marketing is minecraft.
Aug 24 23:49:23 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 24 23:49:31 <[]J>	and how
Aug 24 23:49:42 <Exophase>	I don't know anything about that, but did that game really need it to be successful?
Aug 24 23:50:00 <Exophase>	Somehow I doubt it..
Aug 24 23:50:03 <pandabear41>	Not really.
Aug 24 23:50:18 <Exophase>	One fan video on youtube and people are all over it, spreads like wildfire.
Aug 24 23:50:30 <[]J>	minecraft has some pretty hardcore novelty going for it
Aug 24 23:50:42 <[]J>	Exophase isn't that the definition of viral
Aug 24 23:50:50 <pandabear41>	BYW IDK if you know this bob does not even have a degree and he dropped out of HS.
Aug 24 23:50:56 <pandabear41>	*BTW
Aug 24 23:50:58 <[]J>	not surprised, at all
Aug 24 23:51:15 <Exophase>	A fan video is not marketing.
Aug 24 23:51:15 <Exophase>	It's not done by the author of the game, much less in a deliberate attempt to get other people interested.
Aug 24 23:51:25 <Exophase>	Anyway maybe the literal meaning of "viral" implies that
Aug 24 23:51:35 <[]J>	probably thinking of astroturfing
Aug 24 23:51:43 <[]J>	as opposed to that stupid 4chan definition
Aug 24 23:51:49 <Exophase>	But informally viral advertising refers to something that gains popularity via negative portrayal..
Aug 24 23:52:00 <[]J>	I'm all too well aware
Aug 24 23:52:17 <[]J>	wait "negative" what
Aug 24 23:52:49 <[]J>	there's probably yet another word for that, I'm not sure I've heard it though
Aug 24 23:54:15 <Exophase>	Maybe I'm confusing it with "rebel marketing"
Aug 24 23:54:38 <Exophase>	But I was pretty sure I saw the term first applied to McDonald's Arch Deluxe campaign
Aug 24 23:55:41 <Exophase>	Anyway there's no question that the Bob's Game viral advertising was gaining attention by negatively portrayal of bob
Aug 24 23:56:17 <pandabear41>	"via negative portrayal", IDK about that. the viral marketing that I know is using existing socal-networks, in the form as books, images, videos, articles, tweets, emails, and other forms. To promote something. Letting it spread by people until it is very popular.
Aug 24 23:56:58 <pandabear41>	I might be confused tho. :P
Aug 24 23:57:15 <[]J>	well, seeing as the high point wasn't taken advantage of for a long point, I think we can safely conclude it wasn't orchestrated by a larger corporation
Aug 24 23:57:26 <[]J>	which I think some kooks actually believed
Aug 24 23:58:43 <[]J>	since bob is stupid, it's useless to try and figure out why he does the things he does
Aug 24 23:59:02 <Exophase>	bob himself claimed something along the lines of having been working with whoever on it
Aug 24 23:59:03 <Exophase>	I think..
Aug 24 23:59:13 <[]J>	since the fundamental requirement for guessing his behavior (him not being dumb) isn't there
Aug 24 23:59:16 <Exophase>	But I think he lies about a lot of things like that.
Aug 24 23:59:50 <[]J>	I've seen his personality type only a couple times before, but it's quite noticable. 
Aug 24 23:59:55 <[]J>	my best friend in high school, in fact
Aug 25 00:00:07 <Exophase>	I think bob is just delusional..
Aug 25 00:00:12 <[]J>	seemed to get off on talking shit and making things up, and getting other people riled up and excited
Aug 25 00:00:19 <[]J>	where in fact there was nothing great
Aug 25 00:00:23 <Exophase>	Out of touch with other people.
Aug 25 00:00:36 <[]J>	and he damn well knew it
Aug 25 00:00:37 <Exophase>	Like his original nD ad..
Aug 25 00:00:40 <Exophase>	Was really awful..
Aug 25 00:00:43 <[]J>	xd
Aug 25 00:00:47 <Exophase>	But he was saying how original and great it was..
Aug 25 00:00:49 <[]J>	you can even be american
Aug 25 00:01:06 <Exophase>	Did anyone else actually think it was a good ad?
Aug 25 00:01:39 <pandabear41>	I thought it sucked.
Aug 25 00:02:15 <[]J>	^
Aug 25 00:02:25 <Exophase>	Originally I didn't realize admin was bob and I was scratching my head at someone else thinking the ad was good.
Aug 25 00:02:36 <[]J>	hehe
Aug 25 00:02:51 <gBev>	the original nd ad was terrible, as was the was he delivered it
Aug 25 00:02:51 <Exophase>	"this is the original (vastly better) teaser announcement of the nD which was “not professional enough” (not boring and bland enough) for reporting (pretty much highlights the problem with the game industry, doesn’t it?):"
Aug 25 00:03:00 <Exophase>	I mean he turns everything into a rip on the gaming industry..
Aug 25 00:03:18 <pandabear41>	Well I think the homepage ad is fine.
Aug 25 00:03:19 <gBev>	bob is an idiot with that
Aug 25 00:03:21 <Exophase>	I mean seriously how could it not be "boring or bland enough" ;p
Aug 25 00:03:39 <pandabear41>	The other one is just sucks pure balls.
Aug 25 00:03:40 <Exophase>	I can't think of a more boring or bland way to make an ad than out of nothing but some text being screamed
Aug 25 00:03:44 <gBev>	whenever i've talked to him in the last year he always rants about corporations
Aug 25 00:04:00 <gBev>	like it's news that people are out to make money and that somehow that is stopping him
Aug 25 00:04:05 <pandabear41>	Ha gBev he did the same thing to me.
Aug 25 00:04:21 <Exophase>	He just can't accept that sometimes people don't like his ideas because they just don't like his ideas.
Aug 25 00:04:30 <Exophase>	Everything has to be symptomatic of a problem that's not the least bit related to him.
Aug 25 00:05:03 <gBev>	also apparently he deleted me on skype, lol
Aug 25 00:05:16 <pandabear41>	He deleted me on Google talk. :P
Aug 25 00:05:23 <Exophase>	bob's anti-industry rhetroic is hypocritical too
Aug 25 00:05:34 <pandabear41>	lol ya
Aug 25 00:05:41 <gBev>	the only confrontation i had with him was the little nothing about IRC, if it's over that he's insane
Aug 25 00:05:53 <gBev>	but apparently he's mad at me too now
Aug 25 00:06:03 <Exophase>	I think what was most striking to me was in that bob's game video, the head of the corporation said something along the lines of "do you think the head of Barbie likes playing with dolls? No, they like making money"
Aug 25 00:06:04 <pandabear41>	He gets mad at everyone. :P
Aug 25 00:06:06 <[]J>	I got an idea, bob can advertise his game now as a game made by a single CRAZY individual, over the course of 5 years
Aug 25 00:06:11 <[]J>	using the 3rd person to talk about himself
Aug 25 00:06:17 <Exophase>	But now he's making a handheld with this entire philosophy driven at 6 year olds
Aug 25 00:06:22 <[]J>	it'll sell like hot cakes
Aug 25 00:06:33 <Exophase>	So either he's like a 6 year old or he's just like the Barbie guy..
Aug 25 00:06:39 <[]J>	haha
Aug 25 00:06:42 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 00:07:00 <pandabear41>	He sure acts like a 6 year old at times.
Aug 25 00:07:04 <[]J>	Exophase I have a few guesses, but what exactly are you referring to when you say "just like the barbie guy"?
Aug 25 00:07:25 <Exophase>	I can not read his market plans and manifesto and not think "wow, that's really manipulative"
Aug 25 00:07:49 <Exophase>	[]J; Metaphorically speaking, just saying he's exactly like the guy he had the antagonist describe in the video to try to make a point against the gaming industry.
Aug 25 00:08:02 <Exophase>	And now he's going on about NDAs and whatever
Aug 25 00:08:05 <[]J>	heh
Aug 25 00:08:24 <Exophase>	And is repeatedly justifying things with "that's how the industry does it" and "this is not a charity, it's a business"
Aug 25 00:08:45 <[]J>	no bob, you are the corporation
Aug 25 00:08:49 <[]J>	and then bob was a CEO
Aug 25 00:08:52 <Exophase>	I do actually think getting rich is not his main goal
Aug 25 00:08:59 <Exophase>	But to be honest I'm not sure WHAT his goal is.
Aug 25 00:09:08 <Exophase>	It might just be to live comfortably w/o getting a real job.
Aug 25 00:09:11 <[]J>	oops, forgot the superfluous "s"
Aug 25 00:09:23 <pandabear41>	I personally think he humors over people getting hiped over it.
Aug 25 00:09:26 <Exophase>	Or it might be to get a product in as many hands as possible.
Aug 25 00:09:33 <Exophase>	I really don't know.
Aug 25 00:09:47 <[]J>	his main goal certainly doesn't seem to be "make a good game" ;/
Aug 25 00:09:56 <[]J>	which I value over money
Aug 25 00:10:09 <[]J>	oops why did I bring myself into it, ignore that
Aug 25 00:10:33 <Exophase>	I know if I were making a game that I thought were good I'd want to do what I could to allow people to play it.
Aug 25 00:10:38 <Exophase>	Meaning getting it on as many platforms as I can
Aug 25 00:11:03 <Exophase>	The extreme opposite of this mentality is those people making new Genesis games and whatever..
Aug 25 00:11:09 <Exophase>	And selling a few hundred copies of them.
Aug 25 00:11:30 <Exophase>	bob does seem to want to make it available, but very much on his own terms..
Aug 25 00:11:54 <Exophase>	He claims he could have gotten it on DS afterall but chose not to because he wouldn't have retained rights to the game.
Aug 25 00:12:04 <Exophase>	And then the company could make a "Bob's Game 2" that sucked.. yeah, one step at a time bob
Aug 25 00:12:17 <Exophase>	Somehow I don't really see a Bob's Game 2 happening, but if it did I'm quite sure they'd have him make it.
Aug 25 00:12:28 <pandabear41>	He is planning on making one.
Aug 25 00:12:35 <Exophase>	Right, what I'm saying is..
Aug 25 00:12:43 <pandabear41>	That is some of the stuff he was talking on chat with me. 
Aug 25 00:12:48 <Exophase>	I can see a publisher buying up Bob's Game.
Aug 25 00:12:53 <Exophase>	That's not that unrealistic.
Aug 25 00:12:53 <pandabear41>	He wants to make a mmo bob's game 2. :P
Aug 25 00:12:57 <Exophase>	Assuming the game really is almost done.
Aug 25 00:13:07 <Exophase>	I think it'd sell enough, it's pretty low risk.
Aug 25 00:13:28 <Exophase>	But would a sequel be worth new development costs?
Aug 25 00:13:29 <Exophase>	I doubt that
Aug 25 00:15:32 <Exophase>	Hell, he probably would have made a decent amount of money just selling the ROM.
Aug 25 00:15:48 <pandabear41>	He does not want to though. :P
Aug 25 00:16:02 <Exophase>	Yeah and you know why?
Aug 25 00:16:09 <Exophase>	Because it's his fantasy to be a "legit" game author
Aug 25 00:16:09 <pandabear41>	y?
Aug 25 00:16:16 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 00:16:28 <Exophase>	I mean, to have a real cart of his game sitting in store shelves
Aug 25 00:16:44 <Exophase>	All part of his game industry idealization/nostalgia tripping..
Aug 25 00:17:19 <pandabear41>	He was telling me that he wanted to put it on steam, but then he said the grfx looks crappy on pc, steam has a too small player base, and that people will just torrent it. :P
Aug 25 00:17:56 <[]J>	hahahahahahah
Aug 25 00:18:00 <[]J>	"too small a player base"
Aug 25 00:18:39 <pandabear41>	I showed him the stats and he was still not convinced, and that talk sorta fell out of the chat and was forgotten. :P
Aug 25 00:18:46 <[]J>	nevermind the fact that steam has a policy which lets you sell your game anywhere else you want
Aug 25 00:18:58 <Exophase>	pandabear41; His misconceptions about the PC market are stupid..
Aug 25 00:19:11 <[]J>	I wonder if that means he submitted to them and they rejected him
Aug 25 00:19:18 <pandabear41>	I kno, some of the things he says make me laugh. 
Aug 25 00:19:20 <Exophase>	As if people wouldn't pirate it if it were released for DS..
Aug 25 00:19:56 <pandabear41>	Ya, people will pirate no matter what you do, it is just the life of a software developer. :P
Aug 25 00:21:31 <[]J>	<Exophase> The extreme opposite of this mentality is those people making new Genesis games and whatever..
Aug 25 00:21:34 <[]J>	yes they're also insane
Aug 25 00:21:46 <[]J>	that Battle Kid game for the NES is pretty sweet
Aug 25 00:21:51 <[]J>	but it's like 50bux a pop
Aug 25 00:22:05 <[]J>	and sold only a few hundred copies :1
Aug 25 00:22:34 <Exophase>	Siiigh
Aug 25 00:22:38 <Exophase>	I wish these people would sell ROMs
Aug 25 00:22:46 <[]J>	oh which reminds me, I forgot to buy the game and send the cart to the moon
Aug 25 00:22:49 <[]J>	since I pirated it ;o
Aug 25 00:22:49 <Exophase>	Yeah many would just download it without paying I know..
Aug 25 00:22:54 <Exophase>	But probably thousands would buy..
Aug 25 00:22:57 <[]J>	ja
Aug 25 00:23:01 <Exophase>	Way more than the number of carts they make.
Aug 25 00:23:10 <Exophase>	But then all the collectors complain.
Aug 25 00:23:18 <Exophase>	Because they aren't buying something rare that they can horde.
Aug 25 00:23:21 <Exophase>	And they feel less special.
Aug 25 00:23:28 <Exophase>	It's not about playing the game at all..
Aug 25 00:23:41 <Exophase>	Plus it's not like they can't sell the ROM and a cart + artwork + whatever
Aug 25 00:23:45 <Exophase>	They'd probably still sell the same hundreds..
Aug 25 00:23:49 <Exophase>	Almost guaranteed..
Aug 25 00:24:01 <Exophase>	I think these people just hate emulators
Aug 25 00:24:05 <Exophase>	Because it's "not the real thing"
Aug 25 00:26:16 <pandabear41>	This is funny, "Bob: the indie guys have pretty much blacklisted me in their marketing circle"
Aug 25 00:26:22 <pandabear41>	i'll tell you what, some of those guys are sleazy fuckers
Aug 25 00:26:27 <pandabear41>	i have a bad image but i don't think i'm that bad of a dude
Aug 25 00:26:30 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 25 00:31:49 <Exophase>	Gee, I wonder
Aug 25 00:32:06 <Exophase>	Maybe publicly badmouthing HiB had something to do with that?
Aug 25 00:32:51 <Exophase>	Ugggh, I gargled a bunch of salt water earlier and it helped a lot in breaking up phlegm that was driving me crazy but now I feel really oversalted
Aug 25 00:33:05 <Exophase>	I hope I don't die or anything.
Aug 25 00:38:11 <pandabear41>	No, I hope I don't die or anything.
Aug 25 00:38:17 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 25 00:39:52 <pandabear41>	By either bob, or the mouthwash I just choked on and got a bunch in my lungs. :P

Aug 25 12:10:28 <pandabear41>	hello
Aug 25 12:10:35 <Exophase>	Hi.
Aug 25 12:10:53 <Exophase>	I came home from work because a power line got knocked down and we don't have power in our building :B
Aug 25 12:11:02 <pandabear41>	oh
Aug 25 12:11:21 <pandabear41>	that sucks and rocks at the same time.
Aug 25 12:11:29 <pandabear41>	Do you have to WFH?
Aug 25 12:11:42 <Exophase>	No.
Aug 25 12:12:12 <pandabear41>	Then that is really good. :) I wish the power went out at my work.
Aug 25 12:12:25 <Exophase>	It means I don't get paid though.
Aug 25 12:12:27 <pandabear41>	But that is never going to happen.
Aug 25 12:12:29 <Exophase>	Unless I take vacation today.
Aug 25 12:13:11 <pandabear41>	I get paid no matter what I do, I was being paid to go to the casino to gamble with co-workers. :P
Aug 25 12:13:30 <Syniphas>	where do i send my resume
Aug 25 12:13:36 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 12:13:46 <pandabear41>	:P

Aug 25 12:32:21 <Exophase>	Is the site down for anyone else?
Aug 25 12:32:35 <emusan>	yar
Aug 25 12:32:38 <emusan>	prolly panda lol
Aug 25 12:32:47 <emusan>	are you still a mod?
Aug 25 12:33:16 <pandabear41>	hi
Aug 25 12:33:53 <Exophase>	emusan, no idea
Aug 25 12:34:01 <Exophase>	Since the sie appears down to me.
Aug 25 12:34:06 <emusan>	lol if you are unban me...
Aug 25 12:34:08 <pandabear41>	It's not me, /evil grin "Exophase: Is the site down for anyone else?"
Aug 25 12:34:13 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 12:34:15 <emusan>	are you sure?
Aug 25 12:34:23 <Exophase>	panda did you DoS the site? :/
Aug 25 12:34:28 <JosJuice>	It's down for me too.
Aug 25 12:34:29 <pandabear41>	I am 50% sure. :P
Aug 25 12:34:57 <pandabear41>	Mhahaha, I will redeem you from that crazy person. 
Aug 25 12:35:04 <emusan>	did you see your reason for being banned?
Aug 25 12:35:09 <emusan>	mine was retarded
Aug 25 12:35:29 <Exophase>	panda that's not cool ;p
Aug 25 12:35:45 <pandabear41>	Yah it said, "I hate trolls, so fuck off. Have fun on your friends project"
Aug 25 12:36:13 <Exophase>	You're not even involved on that.
Aug 25 12:36:15 <emusan>	lol mine was because I said he shouldn't use your real name...
Aug 25 12:36:21 <emusan>	as that was an invasion of privacy
Aug 25 12:36:21 <pandabear41>	Exophase, why? Do you like bob?
Aug 25 12:36:22 <Exophase>	... well I don't know what he's actually referring to.
Aug 25 12:36:23 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 12:36:33 <Exophase>	pandabear41; No I don't like bob
Aug 25 12:36:38 <Exophase>	But that doesn't mean that I think you should take down his site..
Aug 25 12:36:43 <Exophase>	Besides it was more than him posting there
Aug 25 12:36:51 <Exophase>	You do shit like this and you'll just get him sympathy.
Aug 25 12:36:55 <Exophase>	Let him fail of his own volition.
Aug 25 12:37:18 <pandabear41>	Well, his site is shit atm and I guess it won't come back for 20 mins or so.
Aug 25 12:37:26 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 12:37:40 <emusan>	two kids got robbed here this morning
Aug 25 12:37:42 <emusan>	by black people
Aug 25 12:38:13 <pandabear41>	What's done is done. I stopped my attacks 5 mins ago and you will just have to wait for it to recover.
Aug 25 12:38:16 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 12:38:28 <Exophase>	pandabear41; Okay.
Aug 25 12:38:34 <pandabear41>	I remember having my bike stolen by some black guys.
Aug 25 12:39:24 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 12:40:03 <pandabear41>	It was in the south and a bunch of people's stuff was stolen by them. Then they sent out a watch saying if you seen anyone that is black call security. 
Aug 25 12:40:13 <pandabear41>	That was at school. :P
Aug 25 12:40:24 <emusan>	wow
Aug 25 12:40:30 <emusan>	no black people in school?
Aug 25 12:40:33 <pandabear41>	Yah
Aug 25 12:40:50 <Exophase>	Geez.
Aug 25 12:40:53 <emusan>	one of my asian friends got put in a dorm with some black gangster kid
Aug 25 12:40:55 <emusan>	he's so scared
Aug 25 12:40:57 <Exophase>	Sure would suck to be black then
Aug 25 12:41:04 <emusan>	he expects to get stabbed any time
Aug 25 12:41:10 <Exophase>	I live in a city that has more black people than white, what's the big deal? ;p
Aug 25 12:41:39 <pandabear41>	That is how it was at my school, Exophase.
Aug 25 12:41:56 <Exophase>	That's kind of sad, that there's fear due to that little racial diversity..
Aug 25 12:42:24 <emusan>	err... my friends roommate is rather odd...
Aug 25 12:42:32 <emusan>	he says he's bringing guns and stuff
Aug 25 12:42:38 <emusan>	has pictures of them on facebook lol
Aug 25 12:42:48 <Exophase>	So the black part is just a coincidence?
Aug 25 12:42:50 <pandabear41>	The school was surrounded by black neighborhoods and 80% of the town was black. And most of the white people were in the kkk or just hated blacks.
Aug 25 12:42:55 <emusan>	exophase, pretty much
Aug 25 12:43:01 <Exophase>	Because most violent thugs don't go to college, regardless of race.
Aug 25 12:43:17 <emusan>	well this guy got in with affirmative action...
Aug 25 12:43:42 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 12:43:44 <Exophase>	I stand by what I said
Aug 25 12:44:22 <emusan>	I'm not really racist or anything lol
Aug 25 12:44:32 <emusan>	half my friends are different races...
Aug 25 12:44:36 <emusan>	but I hate "gangster" kids
Aug 25 12:44:50 <emusan>	cause they're all retarded for the most part, despite having no real problems
Aug 25 12:45:23 <Exophase>	I'm sure a lot of them come from really shitty families.
Aug 25 12:45:27 <pandabear41>	Neither am I. I even told security, that I did not know what race it was who stole my bike. Even though they insisted that it was a black dudes. It could of been someone at the school for all i know.
Aug 25 12:45:46 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 25 12:46:13 <JosJuice>	The website seems to be up.
Aug 25 12:46:15 <emusan>	I know a kid that came from the worst possible family, they beat him day and night and his mom tried to rape him, he went on to MIT
Aug 25 12:46:18 <emusan>	it's a choice as far as I'm concerned
Aug 25 12:46:28 <Exophase>	It's way more than a "choice"
Aug 25 12:46:37 <emusan>	aww still banned...
Aug 25 12:46:39 <Exophase>	Sure nothing applies to everyone
Aug 25 12:46:45 <Exophase>	But you can't argue that there's no impact at all..
Aug 25 12:46:50 <pandabear41>	Still banned here with the cocky reason.
Aug 25 12:47:05 <Exophase>	Especially if you can't go to college because you had to drop out of school to work full time at 16
Aug 25 12:47:06 <emusan>	"Your forum account is currently banned. Ban Reason: because his real name is also his username all over the net, i used it by mistake. i suggest you look to yourself and remove the chip from your shoulder, or you will face great difficulty in your life. i wish you the best of luck.
Aug 25 12:47:07 <emusan>	Ban will be lifted: Never"
Aug 25 12:47:10 <Exophase>	In order to support your broken family.
Aug 25 12:47:13 <emusan>	I'm not saying it doesn't make an impact...
Aug 25 12:47:20 <emusan>	but there are ways to still succeed
Aug 25 12:47:27 <Exophase>	You said it's a choice.
Aug 25 12:47:32 <emusan>	it is
Aug 25 12:47:34 <Exophase>	There are ways you MIGHT succeed
Aug 25 12:47:38 <Exophase>	No one is guaranteed success.
Aug 25 12:47:46 <emusan>	my town puts up millions of dollars a year to help people from the city
Aug 25 12:47:55 <Exophase>	Yeah and I'm sure that barely makes a dent.
Aug 25 12:47:57 <emusan>	half of them use it to push drugs
Aug 25 12:48:44 <emusan>	you still a mod?
Aug 25 12:49:13 <pandabear41>	Heck, my cousin was living in a bad situation and doing wrong things (drugs, killing people, robbing, gang stuff), and one day he decided to change. Now he is working as a manager of a major contractor corporation. He went back to school and got a college degree. 
Aug 25 12:49:28 <emusan>	I know a few people like that too
Aug 25 12:49:35 <emusan>	there are ways to avoid all of it
Aug 25 12:49:36 <Exophase>	pandabear41; He was killing people?
Aug 25 12:49:49 <Exophase>	I'm not happy he's a manager, I'd prefer he were in prison
Aug 25 12:50:00 <pandabear41>	Don't ask, He was in prison for 20 years.
Aug 25 12:50:09 <Exophase>	Well alright
Aug 25 12:50:30 <Exophase>	But it's not like everyone can just suddenly go "okay I'll go to college now"
Aug 25 12:50:33 <pandabear41>	And he did not kill someone, he was an accomplus.
Aug 25 12:50:36 <Exophase>	Good luck when you already have responsibilities..
Aug 25 12:50:41 <Exophase>	And can't get funding..
Aug 25 12:50:55 <emusan>	the government will pay for most if not all if you are low-income
Aug 25 12:51:06 <Exophase>	Yes, I'm more sympathetic to the people who come from asshole families that make lots of money and won't help them with college.
Aug 25 12:51:09 <Exophase>	Then they get nothing from the government.
Aug 25 12:51:20 <emusan>	that's me somewhat
Aug 25 12:51:25 <emusan>	my parents wont pay unless I work
Aug 25 12:51:30 <emusan>	and pay at least half
Aug 25 12:51:32 <pandabear41>	That is me as well.
Aug 25 12:51:36 <Exophase>	But like I said emusan, it doesn't matter if the government will give you a full ride if you still have bills at home..
Aug 25 12:51:55 <emusan>	yes, that is true...
Aug 25 12:52:05 <emusan>	but there are usually ways around stuff like that
Aug 25 12:52:12 <Exophase>	And that's a huge risk, they won't just give it to you for free
Aug 25 12:52:20 <Exophase>	Come on man, "there are ways", there might be ways
Aug 25 12:52:24 <pandabear41>	My parents make so much and they won't give me a penny, and the government or various scholarships would not give me anything. I just worked hard to earn my way to college. :P
Aug 25 12:52:27 <Exophase>	Those will never apply to everyone..
Aug 25 12:52:45 <Exophase>	Anyway, it's a huge risk because a lot of it will still be loans, so after you're out of college you're even more in debt..
Aug 25 12:52:49 <Exophase>	Is that really necessarily the best decision?
Aug 25 12:52:57 <Exophase>	http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-things-nobody-tells-you-about-being-poor/
Aug 25 12:53:00 <Exophase>	Read that the other day..
Aug 25 12:53:14 <Exophase>	It can be hard to get out of a bad financial situation.
Aug 25 12:53:35 <pandabear41>	true, but it is possible. 
Aug 25 12:53:52 <Exophase>	Anything is possible
Aug 25 12:54:00 <Exophase>	I'm sure you two both have your own failings that were possible to avoid..
Aug 25 12:54:13 <emusan>	lol I'm huge :)
Aug 25 12:54:17 <Exophase>	Understand I'm not trying to defend myself, I've never had serious financial problems
Aug 25 12:54:20 <emusan>	and I sweat a ton
Aug 25 12:54:24 <emusan>	but I accept that...
Aug 25 12:54:27 <Exophase>	But I personally think a lot of it has been luck.
Aug 25 12:54:33 <Exophase>	On the flip side I have terrible luck with women.
Aug 25 12:54:54 <Exophase>	And it sucks when people say it's all my fault
Aug 25 12:55:11 <pandabear41>	IDK about luck, It's always about the right decisions and luck almost never plays a part in it.
Aug 25 12:55:18 <Exophase>	Bullshit.
Aug 25 12:55:29 <Exophase>	People have very little power over the world.
Aug 25 12:55:42 <Exophase>	For a lot of things there just ain't enough to go around.
Aug 25 12:55:46 <Exophase>	And people are going to get fucked.
Aug 25 12:56:03 <Exophase>	It's cozy first world mentality that thinks that anyone can have anything if they act right.
Aug 25 12:56:06 <Exophase>	That's all a dream.
Aug 25 12:56:56 <Exophase>	I help my friend out, she's disabled and can't work.. everyone in her life has just expected her to work
Aug 25 12:57:00 <Exophase>	They don't get that it's not the same for her.
Aug 25 12:57:10 <Exophase>	This is what we call bad luck.
Aug 25 12:58:02 <Exophase>	Does that mean give up and stop trying because of bad luck? No. I still do my best, like with meeting women.
Aug 25 12:58:14 <Exophase>	But you can't sit there and tell me that they playing field is level and it's entirely based on what decisions you make.
Aug 25 12:58:24 <Exophase>	Like, I'm only 5'6" tall, that's not due to some bad decision
Aug 25 12:58:33 <pandabear41>	I don't know how luck plays a factor into the picture, it might be my religion skewing my view but I think everything happens because of something, not just because of luck or a force out of the blue.
Aug 25 12:58:35 <Exophase>	And it's stupid to think that has no impact on me.
Aug 25 12:58:56 <pandabear41>	But your height is different.
Aug 25 12:59:00 <Exophase>	Call it luck or call it fate, call it whatever you want, but it's out of our control.
Aug 25 12:59:00 <emusan>	ever hook up with this woman?
Aug 25 12:59:15 <Exophase>	It's best to REALIZE what we can control and FOCUS on that.
Aug 25 12:59:29 <Exophase>	You'll lead a much more productive life.
Aug 25 13:00:34 <pandabear41>	ok
Aug 25 13:00:58 <emusan>	soo... you a mod still exophase?
Aug 25 13:01:07 <pandabear41>	no, he isn't
Aug 25 13:01:27 <Exophase>	Site has been really slow for me.
Aug 25 13:01:28 <emusan>	:(
Aug 25 13:01:37 <Exophase>	bob didn't answer my PM about it, guess he removed it silently then.
Aug 25 13:01:58 <pandabear41>	Exophase, probably the aftermath of my doings.
Aug 25 13:02:05 <Exophase>	I didn't want to be mod anyway
Aug 25 13:02:18 <emusan>	lol it took him forever to ban me
Aug 25 13:02:31 <emusan>	he needs to control his emotions...
Aug 25 13:02:34 <emusan>	I think he's bipolar
Aug 25 13:02:50 <Exophase>	He could be schizophrenic for all I know.
Aug 25 13:07:26 <pandabear41>	"Your forum account is currently banned. Ban Reason: I hate trolls, so fuck off. good luck with your future projects. i'm disappointed to see you go Ban will be lifted: Never" :P crazy
Aug 25 13:08:22 <emusan>	lol

Aug 25 13:09:00 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 13:09:13 <pandabear41>	Bob, blocked all forum registration.
Aug 25 13:09:20 <emusan>	really?
Aug 25 13:09:22 <pandabear41>	Everything has to be approved by him
Aug 25 13:09:25 <emusan>	that's so dumb...
Aug 25 13:09:46 <emusan>	how does he think this kinda stuff is gonna attract investors?
Aug 25 13:09:49 <emusan>	and developers
Aug 25 13:10:16 <pandabear41>	Well I am guessing since it is not real, he does not really care.
Aug 25 13:10:42 <emusan>	true
Aug 25 13:10:55 <pandabear41>	He is in his fantasy, now lets play around with him more.
Aug 25 13:11:24 <emusan>	lol

Aug 25 15:46:29 <gBev>	> because his real name is also his username all over the net, i used it by mistake
Aug 25 15:46:32 <gBev>	what does that mean?
Aug 25 15:46:46 <pandabear41>	it means that bob is a fag.
Aug 25 15:47:05 <emusan>	no...
Aug 25 15:47:11 <emusan>	its cause he used panda's real name
Aug 25 15:47:22 <gBev>	:/ we're not 12 panda
Aug 25 15:47:23 <emusan>	I said that was as much an invasion of privacy as posting the chat logs
Aug 25 15:47:34 <emusan>	he banned me for that
Aug 25 15:47:41 <emusan>	did you see the discussion about the chat logs?
Aug 25 15:47:43 <emusan>	its gone now...
Aug 25 15:47:45 <gBev>	yeah
Aug 25 15:47:47 <gBev>	here

Aug 25 15:48:03 <gBev>	it's just mod only now
Aug 25 15:48:22 <Exophase>	hooray for bob giving people advice about avoiding difficulty in their lives.
Aug 25 15:48:40 <emusan>	lol yay gBev
Aug 25 15:48:56 <emusan>	what's mod only?
Aug 25 15:48:58 <emusan>	oh I see
Aug 25 15:51:37 <pandabear41>	"because his real name is also his username all over the net," is he referring to when he mentioned my name? I never use my real name for my username. :P
Aug 25 15:51:52 <emusan>	yeah
Aug 25 15:51:59 <emusan>	that's why I said he shouldn't use it
Aug 25 15:52:04 <emusan>	then he banned me for that
Aug 25 15:52:17 <emusan>	can't even follow his own privacy rules
Aug 25 15:52:19 <Treeki>	how did he find out your real name?
Aug 25 15:52:43 <emusan>	they were chatting on google chat
Aug 25 15:52:45 <emusan>	I guess it says there
Aug 25 15:52:47 <Treeki>	oh
Aug 25 15:52:52 <pandabear41>	When he chatted with me on google talk, ya
Aug 25 15:52:59 <emusan>	panda offered to help and Bob freaked out at him for no reason
Aug 25 15:53:09 <emusan>	at least that's what I understand happened...
Aug 25 15:53:21 <emusan>	if he would just release the logs we would all know lol
Aug 25 15:54:37 <pandabear41>	Well I offered to help, then after 4 days of him ranting and dishin out attacks to people, I said that I would take a break from bob and the nD (and help a friend). When I came back I made one post about piracy and then he called me a troll. Then I got even more pissed.
Aug 25 15:55:00 <pandabear41>	Then the whole fucking world blew up in our faces.
Aug 25 15:55:04 <pandabear41>	Now we are banned. :P
Aug 25 15:55:24 <emusan>	lol not the whole world, just Bob
Aug 25 15:55:31 <pandabear41>	bob's world
Aug 25 15:55:32 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 25 15:56:21 <emusan>	gbev, there was a little more to the thread...
Aug 25 15:56:27 <emusan>	idk if he deleted them...
Aug 25 15:56:41 <emusan>	they explained why I was banned though, it wasn't for saying he was acting like a 12 year old
Aug 25 15:56:43 <pandabear41>	He deleted the last few posts that we posted.
Aug 25 15:57:04 <emusan>	such an annoying move
Aug 25 15:57:11 <emusan>	I hate overzealous admins
Aug 25 15:57:28 <--	JosJuice (~JosJuice@synIRC-A8999FBA.bredband.comhem.se) has left #nD
Aug 25 15:57:44 <pandabear41>	They also contained how bob said fine he will post the logs, but it might offend people. Then he said that no he won't and just ban us.
Aug 25 15:59:49 <gBev>	i unbanned you emusan, i want to see what happens
Aug 25 16:00:08 <emusan>	lol I hope he doesn't get pissed at you...
Aug 25 16:00:14 <gBev>	he probably will
Aug 25 16:00:17 <emusan>	wouldn't wanna cause you to get banned :(
Aug 25 16:00:25 <pandabear41>	With bob's mental state he will probably ban you.
Aug 25 16:00:31 <gBev>	that's kind of why, i want to see how insane he is
Aug 25 16:00:46 <gBev>	he could 1) reban you and tell me not to do it again
Aug 25 16:00:46 <pandabear41>	Hey want the logs those speak for themself.
Aug 25 16:00:52 <gBev>	2) reban you and demod me
Aug 25 16:00:56 <gBev>	3) reban you and ban me
Aug 25 16:01:11 <gBev>	depending on what he does, we can see how crazy he's gotten
Aug 25 16:01:22 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 16:01:23 <pandabear41>	emusan, you should post somewhere, "I'm back!"
Aug 25 16:01:25 <emusan>	should I post then?

Aug 25 16:10:42 <emusan>	he prolly doesn't know how to find out who did it
Aug 25 16:10:47 <emusan>	he is horrid with forum software
Aug 25 16:11:49 <pandabear41>	lol, he is kinda dumb with the forums and wikis. His media wiki is so old there are about 3 exploits for it. :P
Aug 25 16:12:21 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 16:12:48 <Treeki>	I was writing a forum system to be used on the bob's game forums once
Aug 25 16:13:00 <Treeki>	then he decided to go with MyBB instead
Aug 25 16:13:10 <Treeki>	were it not for that, the-nd.com might be powered by my software!
Aug 25 16:13:19 <pandabear41>	MyBB sucks anyways. :P
Aug 25 16:13:35 <gBev>	Treeki correction: I decided to go with myBB

Aug 25 16:14:29 <gBev>	and i agreed

Aug 25 17:08:07 <Exophase>	If Nintendo had so little money they wouldn't be able to develop and publish dozens of games.
Aug 25 17:08:09 <pandabear41>	I still want to know what drugs he is doing.
Aug 25 17:08:17 <emusan>	lets ask!
Aug 25 17:08:21 <emusan>	to the email!
Aug 25 17:08:30 <pandabear41>	I did ask but bob deleted the post.

Aug 25 17:10:09 <pandabear41>	aka me
Aug 25 17:10:19 <pandabear41>	not me but I did create that account.
Aug 25 17:11:02 <pandabear41>	I wanted to post on the forums the log when he calls his game a fucking joke, and then says that he is his friend.
Aug 25 17:11:18 <pandabear41>	And that he personally knows him.
Aug 25 17:11:33 <pandabear41>	Even though he said complete trash about his game before.
Aug 25 17:14:09 <pandabear41>	here is the log http://pastebin.com/dBBt8CPS
Aug 25 17:14:30 <pandabear41>	If you read the first lines and the last lines it makes me laugh.

Aug 25 17:23:58 <emusan>	good luck with that one bob
Aug 25 17:24:37 <pandabear41>	He first blows it away saying it is a fucking joke and then 4 or so hours later he is like I should ask him to port it.
Aug 25 17:24:43 <pandabear41>	Even though I said it sucks.
Aug 25 17:25:06 <pandabear41>	What kind of logic is that?
Aug 25 17:26:28 <emusan>	terraria wouldn't even work without a mouse
Aug 25 17:26:31 <emusan>	god bob is retarted
Aug 25 17:26:41 <pandabear41>	lol
Aug 25 17:26:53 <emusan>	"It's super easy to port anything from PC"
Aug 25 17:26:55 <emusan>	fuck that
Aug 25 17:27:02 <pandabear41>	It is like the same thing he said about the HiB.
Aug 25 17:27:15 <emusan>	it requires a full on re-code and new control schemes
Aug 25 17:27:30 <pandabear41>	Especially moving c# to c++
Aug 25 17:27:54 <pandabear41>	No handy dandy, classes that microsoft has built in.
Aug 25 17:28:24 <emusan>	yup
Aug 25 17:28:36 <emusan>	and switching from directX to SDL wont be fun either lol
Aug 25 17:28:40 <emusan>	so much more limiting
Aug 25 17:28:49 <pandabear41>	terraria is in xna.
Aug 25 17:28:54 <pandabear41>	:P
Aug 25 17:29:28 <emusan>	doesn't that use DirectX?
Aug 25 17:29:34 <emusan>	I'm not really familiar with that though
Aug 25 17:30:12 <pandabear41>	yah it uses directX and some other stuff.
Aug 25 17:36:31 *	pandabear41 thinks it would be fun to push the off button on the nD forums.
Aug 25 17:37:03 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 17:37:10 *	emusan would rather wait until I could see it
Aug 25 17:37:22 <emusan>	err

Aug 25 17:41:33 <pandabear41>	One of the dorms at my BS school would get naked and run other dorms taking people and throwing them into the showers.
Aug 25 17:41:58 <emusan>	lol

Aug 25 17:42:02 <emusan>	I guess
Aug 25 17:42:10 <emusan>	anyone naked runs into my room and they get castrated
Aug 25 17:42:53 <pandabear41>	We would pile up mattresses in the hallways and beat them with pool noodles if they ran the floor I stayed on

Aug 25 20:41:24 <emusan>	well... he banned me because I said he shouldn't use panda's real name if panda doesn't want him to
Aug 25 20:41:40 <emusan>	they were discussing privacy at the time and I thought it relevant...
Aug 25 20:41:48 <emusan>	it was deleted from the thread gbev posted...
Aug 25 20:42:02 <Exophase>	He called panda a psycho ;p

Aug 25 20:42:43 <gBev>	he's getting crazy with controlling the forum
Aug 25 20:42:53 <gBev>	he seems to patrol it constantly too
Aug 25 20:43:02 <pandabear41>	<pandabear41> This http://pastebin.com/34dptATp
Aug 25 20:43:12 <gBev>	Time Spent Online:	1 Week, 2 Days, 17 Hours, 27 Minutes, 26 Seconds
Aug 25 20:43:39 <emusan>	wow
Aug 25 20:43:43 <emusan>	mine prolly wasn't far off though
Aug 25 20:43:45 <emusan>	lol
Aug 25 20:44:20 <pandabear41>	Plus on top of that he said to me some threats that he would harm my family and me. After someone told him I pasted  that log above in irc.
Aug 25 20:44:44 <emusan>	was that on the forums?
Aug 25 20:44:47 <emusan>	or in gchat?
Aug 25 20:44:53 <pandabear41>	google talk.
Aug 25 20:45:04 <Exophase>	He uh what?
Aug 25 20:45:22 <pandabear41>	Didn't you read what I said before I left for food.
Aug 25 20:45:44 <emusan>	I wasn't there...
Aug 25 20:46:03 <pandabear41>	Yah sec let me load mbitirc
Aug 25 20:46:31 <Exophase>	pandabear I don't think you're going to get him imprisoned for making internet threats.
Aug 25 20:47:11 <pandabear41>	Yah, I did some research and I can;t. It would be too much hastle to get even close.
Aug 25 20:47:20 <gBev>	imprisoned?
Aug 25 20:47:22 <gBev>	no way
Aug 25 20:47:37 <gBev>	it's just the point that he's acting in a very unprofessional fashion
Aug 25 20:48:05 <Exophase>	gBev; panda said this
Aug 25 20:48:13 <Exophase>	[19:08:46] <pandabear41> Whoever is the mole in here, tell bob that he better get used to jail, because I am going to press charges on him for making life threats to my family and me.
Aug 25 20:48:24 <gBev>	okay well that is absurd
Aug 25 20:49:10 <Treeki>	am I the only one who thinks that bob is turning into one of the game industry execs he hated so much? down to the "games are toys, you shouldn't be playing with them, they're for kids" crap
Aug 25 20:49:18 <Exophase>	Treeki; Not at all.
Aug 25 20:49:22 <Exophase>	But I was thinking that since day one..
Aug 25 20:49:30 <pandabear41>	Same
Aug 25 20:49:32 <Treeki>	he's totally different from the bob I remember from the bob's game days
Aug 25 20:49:49 <Exophase>	Maybe he's getting more desperate for income?
Aug 25 20:49:55 <Exophase>	Says he hasn't worked a day since 2002..
Aug 25 20:49:59 <gBev>	the bob from the bob's game days (outside of the viral nonsense) was a pretty nice, easygoing guy
Aug 25 20:50:05 <gBev>	i don't know who the hell this is
Aug 25 20:50:40 <gBev>	as for money, he's been surviving on stocks. i'm sure you can imagine him not doing well with money lately
Aug 25 20:50:58 <Exophase>	He told panda he was managing on inheritance money.
Aug 25 20:51:06 <Exophase>	That has since run out.
Aug 25 20:51:11 <pandabear41>	Treeki, This is one of the logs, http://pastebin.com/dBBt8CPS
Aug 25 20:51:41 <Treeki>	I saw that a while ago
Aug 25 20:51:42 <pandabear41>	That was one of the many attacks he does to developers and other people. 
Aug 25 20:51:49 <Treeki>	also, I'm pretty sure the SMBX C&D was a hoax
Aug 25 20:51:58 <Treeki>	just so he could "clean" himself from it and release Terraria
Aug 25 20:52:05 <pandabear41>	THat is why I stopped talking to him and left the forums for a few weeks.
Aug 25 20:52:53 <pandabear41>	And I did not give him the files that he wanted because I personally don't like the attacks and insane talk he rants on everytime he chatted with me.
Aug 25 20:53:00 <emusan>	technick... any opinion?
Aug 25 20:53:09 <pandabear41>	I even appeared offline to avoid his chats.
Aug 25 20:53:09 <gBev>	we're talking
Aug 25 20:53:15 <emusan>	oh.. okay
Aug 25 20:56:06 <emusan>	lol I don't really mind not having an account though... I stopped posting awhile ago anyway, I just wanted to chime in about him calling panda crazy, etc.
Aug 25 20:56:16 <emusan>	even though I'm now working on programming a game with some guy for it lol

Sep 12 16:26:07 <Stryker001>	whatchya up to?
Sep 12 16:26:10 <Stryker001>	college
Sep 12 16:26:32 <pandabear41>	work, other crap.
Sep 12 16:27:03 <Stryker001>	yeah. I know how it is... I'm *trying* to get a job as a tutor @ the college
Sep 12 16:27:09 <Stryker001>	hope it works out...
Sep 12 16:28:06 <pandabear41>	I tried being a tutor once during college, I hated it. People are soo dumb and most of them think they are always right.
Sep 12 16:28:14 <Stryker001>	also been writing when I'm not doing school :P
Sep 12 16:28:31 <pandabear41>	IDK it might of been that the few people that I tutored were dicks.
Sep 12 16:29:17 <Stryker001>	yeah
Sep 12 16:29:42 <Stryker001>	it's free to the tutees, so I have no idea who I'll end up with. At least I'll get paid a little.
Sep 12 16:31:32 <pandabear41>	Free tutoring was what I did, I got paid minimum wage.
Sep 12 16:31:57 <Stryker001>	yeah. 7.50 an hour
Sep 12 16:32:03 <Stryker001>	better than nothing. :)
Sep 12 16:32:46 <pandabear41>	yah, i guess
Sep 12 16:32:59 <Stryker001>	so what about you? what have you been doing lately?
Sep 12 16:34:05 <pandabear41>	I said work, and other crap.
Sep 12 16:34:19 <Stryker001>	right
Sep 12 16:34:32 <Stryker001>	what do you do as work?
Sep 12 16:34:45 <pandabear41>	Silicon Validation
Sep 12 16:36:11 <Stryker001>	like, post- or pre-?
Sep 12 16:36:18 <Stryker001>	I assume post-.
Sep 12 16:36:23 <pandabear41>	yea
Sep 12 16:36:50 <Stryker001>	cool. who do you work for? a specific company, or just general contracted work?
Sep 12 16:37:20 <pandabear41>	Intel.
Sep 12 16:38:26 <Stryker001>	oh that's neat.
Sep 12 16:38:43 <Stryker001>	at least that's related to a lot of big-name equipment, too
Sep 12 16:38:50 <Stryker001>	like Apple :P
Sep 12 16:41:15 <pandabear41>	Yah, I love apple.
Sep 12 16:41:39 <Stryker001>	Yeah... who doesn't? :P
Sep 12 16:43:54 <pandabear41>	60% of the rest of the ppl who is in this channel (or who used to visit it often) :P
Sep 12 16:44:07 <Stryker001>	huh lol
Sep 12 16:44:47 <Stryker001>	I honestly don't understand why people don't like Macs. You can run MS software, and yes, you *can* right-click. *sigh*
Sep 12 16:45:12 <Syniphas>	i don't like macs for the same reason i don't like linux
Sep 12 16:45:29 <pandabear41>	Plus if you don't like osx you can just bootcamp.
Sep 12 16:45:29 <Stryker001>	not used to it?
Sep 12 16:45:30 <Syniphas>	most of the software i'm used to using isn't available for them
Sep 12 16:45:46 <Stryker001>	@panda exactly
Sep 12 16:45:48 <Syniphas>	linux is terrible for music composing/audio mixing
Sep 12 16:45:54 <pandabear41>	or parallels. :P
Sep 12 16:46:05 <Syniphas>	i don't have anything against people who prefer those OSes, though
Sep 12 16:46:07 <Stryker001>	Yeah, Linux ain't made for artists. lol
Sep 12 16:46:12 <Syniphas>	just don't try to force me to use them.
Sep 12 16:46:16 <Stryker001>	yeah
Sep 12 16:46:18 <Syniphas>	(a lot of people do)
Sep 12 16:46:24 <Stryker001>	that's a good point
Sep 12 16:46:40 <Syniphas>	my friend is like

Sep 12 16:48:47 <Stryker001>	okay w/windows =/= hates linux or mac.
Sep 12 16:48:51 <Syniphas>	except instead of helping you, people are more interested in:
Sep 12 16:49:09 <Stryker001>	everything but. lol
Sep 12 16:49:09 <Syniphas>	1) making fun of you for not knowing how to solve it yourself
Sep 12 16:49:20 <Syniphas>	2) gloating about how drunk they are
Sep 12 16:49:40 <Syniphas>	3) telling you you're doing everything wrong and should start by wiping off your hdd and installing another distro of linux on it
Sep 12 16:49:51 <Syniphas>	4) warning you about how drunk the other users are
Sep 12 16:49:57 <pandabear41>	5) laughing at your question or telling you to search google.

Sep 14 18:59:38 <MPQC>	PC/DS

Sep 14 19:00:46 <ShadyGuy>	Derp
Sep 14 19:00:50 <ShadyGuy>	Not THOSE graphics
Sep 14 19:00:51 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:00:53 <MPQC>	I mean, look at how big the PC screens are, they've got to be pixelated

Sep 14 19:01:18 <ShadyGuy>	Except my one stupid friend
Sep 14 19:01:23 <ShadyGuy>	Who defends the original to the death
Sep 14 19:01:24 <Stryker001>	it's got more "spectacular highlights", I believe the term is
Sep 14 19:01:38 <MPQC>	No, it's just the magnets blend in with the wall
Sep 14 19:01:40 <Stryker001>	well, it really depends who your audience is
Sep 14 19:01:46 <Stryker001>	but I assumed that was for the nD
Sep 14 19:01:52 <MPQC>	The first one they stick  out like a sore thumb, it's a mix of styles
Sep 14 19:01:53 <ShadyGuy>	Its an iOS/Android game
Sep 14 19:02:01 <ShadyGuy>	The magnets are temporary
Sep 14 19:02:14 <Stryker001>	ag
Sep 14 19:02:16 <Stryker001>	*ah
Sep 14 19:02:34 <Stryker001>	in the non-hug7y version, the walls match the theme better
Sep 14 19:02:44 <Stryker001>	so i can honestly understand your friend's postion
Sep 14 19:02:52 <Stryker001>	is he a graphic artist?
Sep 14 19:03:07 <ShadyGuy>	Meh
Sep 14 19:03:08 <ShadyGuy>	Sorta
Sep 14 19:03:14 <MPQC>	It's either you change the magnets or you change the walls, either way the first one sucks lol
Sep 14 19:03:14 <ShadyGuy>	Not for games
Sep 14 19:03:17 <ShadyGuy>	He does website stuffs
Sep 14 19:03:20 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:03:24 <Stryker001>	ah
Sep 14 19:03:25 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:03:38 <ShadyGuy>	The graphics arent completed, the only new things i had were the ball, the ground, the walls, and the stars lol
Sep 14 19:03:47 <ShadyGuy>	The background and stuff would be redone to fit
Sep 14 19:03:48 <Stryker001>	physics?
Sep 14 19:03:54 <ShadyGuy>	Pixel perfect
Sep 14 19:03:56 <ShadyGuy>	;)
Sep 14 19:03:59 <Stryker001>	like, does the ball bounce and respond to gravity?
Sep 14 19:04:03 <ShadyGuy>	Yep
Sep 14 19:04:08 <Stryker001>	or is it just the f*cking magnets?
Sep 14 19:04:10 <ShadyGuy>	Gravity of 9.8 just like Earth :3
Sep 14 19:04:12 <Stryker001>	oh sweet
Sep 14 19:04:14 <Stryker001>	nice
Sep 14 19:04:28 <ShadyGuy>	The point of some levels is to bounce it 
Sep 14 19:04:31 <MPQC>	9.8........Pixels?
Sep 14 19:04:32 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:04:36 <Stryker001>	I'm making something similar for a Lego robotics platform, so I've got a 64x100 monochrome screen
Sep 14 19:04:37 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:04:43 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:04:46 <Stryker001>	9.8 m/s^2
Sep 14 19:04:53 <Stryker001>	not pixels
Sep 14 19:04:57 <MPQC>	And how do you convert m/s to pixels
Sep 14 19:04:59 <MPQC>	:P
Sep 14 19:05:05 <ShadyGuy>	It has the same effect
Sep 14 19:05:06 <Stryker001>	it's the measurement of gravity (*acceleration)
Sep 14 19:05:06 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:05:07 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:05:11 <Stryker001>	meters/second...
Sep 14 19:05:15 <MPQC>	9.8 Pixels ^_^
Sep 14 19:05:16 <Stryker001>	it doesn't "convert"
Sep 14 19:05:32 <Stryker001>	you have to use fun equations  :D
Sep 14 19:05:38 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:05:51 <ShadyGuy>	You can alter gravity in some levels
Sep 14 19:05:54 <ShadyGuy>	You hit a button
Sep 14 19:05:56 <ShadyGuy>	Then tilt your device
Sep 14 19:06:01 <ShadyGuy>	And the gravity changes C:
Sep 14 19:06:11 <Stryker001>	now, are you reading the Gyros or the Accelerometers?
Sep 14 19:06:19 <ShadyGuy>	accelerometers
Sep 14 19:06:31 <Stryker001>	good
Sep 14 19:06:40 <Stryker001>	so you're actually reading gravity, not calculating it
Sep 14 19:06:48 <Stryker001>	*rubs hands* this is perfect....
Sep 14 19:06:51 <ShadyGuy>	O.o
Sep 14 19:06:52 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:07:12 <MPQC>	:C
Sep 14 19:07:15 <Stryker001>	do you have the option to code in Gyro readings as well?
Sep 14 19:07:40 <ShadyGuy>	I'm looking right now lol
Sep 14 19:07:40 <Stryker001>	or do you just have accels?
Sep 14 19:07:51 <MPQC>	Well...Gravity is still 9.8 whether or not you tilt something or not
Sep 14 19:07:53 <MPQC>	Just saying....
Sep 14 19:07:53 <ShadyGuy>	Yes
Sep 14 19:07:55 <ShadyGuy>	I have both
Sep 14 19:07:58 <Stryker001>	coolio
Sep 14 19:08:15 <ShadyGuy>	http://developer.anscamobile.com/reference/index
Sep 14 19:08:17 <Stryker001>	@mpqc: you're missing the point. but that's quite understandable, since I haven't made it yet :3
Sep 14 19:08:17 <ShadyGuy>	:3
Sep 14 19:08:26 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:08:31 <ShadyGuy>	Its in the 'events' section
Sep 14 19:08:34 <ShadyGuy>	:3
Sep 14 19:08:43 <MPQC>	Well you said gravity changes when you tilt it :(
Sep 14 19:08:47 <Stryker001>	the point is, you can shake/bump the phone while it's held level... and it will still respond (thought not as accurately)
Sep 14 19:09:01 <Stryker001>	much like in a pinball game, where you"tilt" the table
Sep 14 19:09:09 <Stryker001>	or bump it
Sep 14 19:09:14 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:09:57 <Stryker001>	the sideways acceleration will be read as acceleration, and it (depending on your code) won't be able to tell if it's just been tilted strongly for a short period of time or actually shaken
Sep 14 19:10:27 <MPQC>	So if I hold it 45 degrees it'll be max? Or straight up & down
Sep 14 19:10:38 <ShadyGuy>	For the accelerometer?
Sep 14 19:10:40 <MPQC>	Or horizontal O_O
Sep 14 19:10:41 <ShadyGuy>	Spin it all the way around
Sep 14 19:10:42 <ShadyGuy>	:P
Sep 14 19:10:45 <Stryker001>	90º
Sep 14 19:10:47 <Stryker001>	not 45
Sep 14 19:10:52 <MPQC>	90 Degrees which direction
Sep 14 19:11:00 <ShadyGuy>	If you tilt the device upside down
Sep 14 19:11:01 <Stryker001>	really, it depends on the code
Sep 14 19:11:05 <ShadyGuy>	The ball will fall to the ceiling
Sep 14 19:11:11 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 19:11:12 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:11:17 <ShadyGuy>	So basically
Sep 14 19:11:19 <ShadyGuy>	Every direction
Sep 14 19:11:20 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:11:21 <Stryker001>	so you're using all three vectors from the accelerometer?
Sep 14 19:11:26 <MPQC>	Hm
Sep 14 19:11:27 <Stryker001>	and rendering all 3 vectors?
Sep 14 19:11:33 <MPQC>	I wish you best of luck with that
Sep 14 19:11:33 <Stryker001>	that's intersting
Sep 14 19:11:36 <MPQC>	Seriously lol
Sep 14 19:11:47 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:11:50 <ShadyGuy>	I already did it
Sep 14 19:11:57 <ShadyGuy>	you dont need to wish me luck
Sep 14 19:11:57 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:12:01 <MPQC>	:(
Sep 14 19:12:18 <Stryker001>	we should work together on this code. I'm full of ideas and graphics and little hidden secrets, but I'm fed up with the platform I'm working with.
Sep 14 19:12:36 <ShadyGuy>	Its coded in Lua
Sep 14 19:12:53 <Stryker001>	"I already did it"... there can *always* be a 2.0.
Sep 14 19:13:04 <Stryker001>	Cool! another language to learn. lol
Sep 14 19:13:05 <MPQC>	2.MPQC
Sep 14 19:13:11 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:13:12 <Stryker001>	:3
Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	local function onTilt( event )
Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	    if gravbuttonon==true then
Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	        physics.setGravity( 10 * event.xGravity, -10 * event.yGravity )
Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	    end
Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	end

Sep 14 19:13:14 <ShadyGuy>	Runtime:addEventListener( "accelerometer" , onTilt)
Sep 14 19:13:23 <Stryker001>	whoa
Sep 14 19:13:26 <ShadyGuy>	Thats my accelerometer event
Sep 14 19:13:26 <Stryker001>	how do you do that?
Sep 14 19:13:34 <Stryker001>	I can never get it to break up lines -__-
Sep 14 19:13:41 <ShadyGuy>	I just copied and pasted lol
Sep 14 19:13:43 <ShadyGuy>	B
Sep 14 19:13:46 <ShadyGuy>	Hm
Sep 14 19:13:48 <Stryker001>	shift-enters?
Sep 14 19:13:53 <ShadyGuy>	nope
Sep 14 19:13:55 <ShadyGuy>	I just tried that
Sep 14 19:13:55 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:13:56 <Stryker001>	huh
Sep 14 19:13:58 <ShadyGuy>	Oh wait
Sep 14 19:14:04 <ShadyGuy>	On my client
Sep 14 19:14:05 <Stryker001>	you're not using Mibbit
Sep 14 19:14:06 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:14:08 <ShadyGuy>	I can hit alt+enter
Sep 14 19:14:09 <Stryker001>	duh
Sep 14 19:14:15 <Stryker001>	line1
Sep 14 19:14:20 <ShadyGuy>	And
Sep 14 19:14:20 <ShadyGuy>	type
Sep 14 19:14:20 <ShadyGuy>	like
Sep 14 19:14:20 <ShadyGuy>	this
Sep 14 19:14:22 <Stryker001>	doesn't work here
Sep 14 19:14:38 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:15:04 <Stryker001>	so event.yGravity is actually the code to read the Y vector?
Sep 14 19:15:12 <ShadyGuy>	Yar
Sep 14 19:15:17 <Stryker001>	or are you using a var called yGravity and storing it there?
Sep 14 19:15:28 <ShadyGuy>	no thats right
Sep 14 19:15:33 <Stryker001>	oh that is so cool
Sep 14 19:15:41 <ShadyGuy>	xGravity and yGravity don't need to be defined at all
Sep 14 19:15:44 <Stryker001>	way better than C/C#/C++
Sep 14 19:15:46 <ShadyGuy>	Its just understood by that particular event
Sep 14 19:15:51 <Stryker001>	coolio
Sep 14 19:16:00 <ShadyGuy>	Infact
Sep 14 19:16:06 <ShadyGuy>	Nothing has to be defined officially
Sep 14 19:16:16 <Stryker001>	whoa nice
Sep 14 19:16:19 <ShadyGuy>	you need a variable, you just throw it in there
Sep 14 19:16:23 <Stryker001>	you can just dump it in whenver
Sep 14 19:16:25 <Stryker001>	that's sweet
Sep 14 19:16:41 <Stryker001>	I need to learn Lua. Now. :P
Sep 14 19:16:45 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:16:49 <ShadyGuy>	Here's the code to create a wall block
Sep 14 19:16:50 <Stryker001>	except  have nothing to use it on lol
Sep 14 19:16:58 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	local wall = display.newImage("spr_wall.png")
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	localGroup:insert( wall )
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	wall.x=display.contentWidth-16
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	wall.y=304-192
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	wall.myName="wall"
Sep 14 19:17:00 <ShadyGuy>	physics.addBody(wall,"static",{ friction=0.5, bounce=0.3 } )
Sep 14 19:17:05 <Stryker001>	mpqc, what language(s) do you use?
Sep 14 19:17:18 <MPQC>	Well schools using java atm, so java
Sep 14 19:17:21 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:17:24 <Stryker001>	haha
Sep 14 19:17:25 <Stryker001>	cool
Sep 14 19:17:41 <MPQC>	They were doing python last year, and then this year, everyone comes to class
Sep 14 19:17:45 <MPQC>	"WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?!?!?!"
Sep 14 19:17:50 <Stryker001>	I started trying to teach myself Java, because I wanted to write a few apps for my phone, but the SDK sucks bullocks
Sep 14 19:17:51 <MPQC>	Then they realize how similiar it was
Sep 14 19:18:07 <Stryker001>	python=peice of cake.... usually
Sep 14 19:18:13 <ShadyGuy>	I self taught all my stuffs :3
Sep 14 19:18:14 <MPQC>	I hate the IDE I'm using, it completes my brackets for me and I double bracket every single time
Sep 14 19:18:15 <ShadyGuy>	Lua is really
Sep 14 19:18:18 <ShadyGuy>	REALLY easy
Sep 14 19:18:26 <Stryker001>	yeah
Sep 14 19:18:30 <ShadyGuy>	If you have ANY coding experience which you obviously do
Sep 14 19:18:31 <Stryker001>	so I've gathered
Sep 14 19:18:33 <ShadyGuy>	This will take maybe
Sep 14 19:18:34 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 19:18:35 <ShadyGuy>	5 minutes
Sep 14 19:18:36 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:18:44 <ShadyGuy>	You just gotta learn some formatting stuff for iPod apps
Sep 14 19:18:51 <Stryker001>	I've trained my mind to think in linear, C-based stuff though
Sep 14 19:18:52 <Stryker001>	:(
Sep 14 19:18:57 <MPQC>	Obj-C -ew-
Sep 14 19:19:03 <Stryker001>	kinda hard to switch to like java or lua
Sep 14 19:19:03 <MPQC>	Just saying
Sep 14 19:19:07 <Stryker001>	@mpqc yeah
Sep 14 19:19:17 <Stryker001>	but it's what I had at the time
Sep 14 19:19:29 <Stryker001>	(I was coding for "the one with two screens")
Sep 14 19:19:38 <ShadyGuy>	Lua is a math stud too lol
Sep 14 19:19:45 <ShadyGuy>	It calculates shit so fast
Sep 14 19:19:46 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:19:50 <ShadyGuy>	Its like
Sep 14 19:19:53 <Stryker001>	floating point, I presume?
Sep 14 19:19:57 <ShadyGuy>	The annoying chinese kid in class
Sep 14 19:20:00 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:20:00 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:20:02 <ShadyGuy>	Except less annoying
Sep 14 19:20:05 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:20:07 <ShadyGuy>	And less chinese
Sep 14 19:20:10 <ShadyGuy>	except for the math part
Sep 14 19:20:10 <MPQC>	I dunno about you guys, but Python has the best built in sort
Sep 14 19:20:11 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:20:22 <Stryker001>	not familiar with "sort"
Sep 14 19:20:24 <Stryker001>	sorry
Sep 14 19:20:28 <MPQC>	I like made my own and it takes a few ms, the built in one literally can do a few hundred terms in <1ms
Sep 14 19:20:47 <ShadyGuy>	My friend made a text encrypter in Lua
Sep 14 19:20:47 <Stryker001>	can you do it in C? /joking
Sep 14 19:20:50 <MPQC>	Bubble sort..Merge..Insertion..Selection...etc
Sep 14 19:20:55 <Stryker001>	cool
Sep 14 19:21:04 <MPQC>	You can do everything in C :P
Sep 14 19:21:07 <Stryker001>	yeah, C is okay for math
Sep 14 19:21:10 <Stryker001>	but exactly
Sep 14 19:21:12 <ShadyGuy>	echk`echt`~ei`e`ehk`ecci`~ect`echt`ect`
Sep 14 19:21:16 <Stryker001>	it's made to do everything
Sep 14 19:21:16 <ShadyGuy>	That says
Sep 14 19:21:17 <MPQC>	aicha aicha
Sep 14 19:21:20 <ShadyGuy>	YO DAWG LOL
Sep 14 19:21:24 <Stryker001>	so it doesn't do much well
Sep 14 19:21:28 <Stryker001>	LOL
Sep 14 19:21:41 <Stryker001>	interesting encryption algo.
Sep 14 19:21:45 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:21:47 <Stryker001>	I love me some algos.
Sep 14 19:21:49 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 19:21:54 <ShadyGuy>	Its based on something he saw on the X-files
Sep 14 19:21:56 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:22:16 <ShadyGuy>	Dude
Sep 14 19:22:19 <ShadyGuy>	I need some aloe for my nose
Sep 14 19:22:19 <Stryker001>	hey, do either of you do much with visual processing? Like, taking a camera input and doing line detection, for example?
Sep 14 19:22:20 <ShadyGuy>	right now
Sep 14 19:22:21 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:22:23 <Stryker001>	aww
Sep 14 19:22:25 <Stryker001>	sunburnt?
Sep 14 19:22:29 <ShadyGuy>	yes
Sep 14 19:22:30 <ShadyGuy>	I think so
Sep 14 19:22:30 <MPQC>	I did some image maniputlation
Sep 14 19:22:31 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:22:37 <MPQC>	Sp****
Sep 14 19:22:38 <ShadyGuy>	Berb :P
Sep 14 19:22:39 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:22:49 <Stryker001>	sp????
Sep 14 19:22:54 <Stryker001>	sorry
Sep 14 19:22:54 <MPQC>	SPelling
Sep 14 19:22:59 <Stryker001>	I'm really dumb today
Sep 14 19:23:01 <MPQC>	:P
Sep 14 19:23:28 <MPQC>	What I had to do for one project was detect if an image was similar... Probably could easily do lines
Sep 14 19:23:35 <Stryker001>	huh
Sep 14 19:23:37 <MPQC>	Used the worlds slowest library, you sit there for literally 10 mins
Sep 14 19:23:39 <MPQC>	lmao
Sep 14 19:23:49 <Stryker001>	lolz
Sep 14 19:24:48 <Stryker001>	I just have a phone with a camera and touch screen, no gyro/accelerometer, and I figured if I could keep track of one line (in the camera's view), I could calculate the [Delta]angle of the line and thus the [Delta] angle of the phone
Sep 14 19:24:58 <Stryker001>	but I have never done image processing
Sep 14 19:25:07 <MPQC>	Sounds tough
Sep 14 19:25:16 <Stryker001>	not really, in theory
Sep 14 19:25:27 <Stryker001>	you just have to find a clash of color
Sep 14 19:25:28 <MPQC>	Key words in there
Sep 14 19:25:37 <MPQC>	Low quality cameras will rape your results
Sep 14 19:25:38 <Stryker001>	you could really just use b&w though
Sep 14 19:25:41 <Stryker001>	meh
Sep 14 19:25:59 <Stryker001>	I rock smoothing algos, though, so it wouldn't be a problem
Sep 14 19:26:22 <Stryker001>	it would give me basic gyro functionality
Sep 14 19:26:24 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 19:26:46 <MPQC>	:P
Sep 14 19:26:50 <Stryker001>	at worst, you'd have to resort to blob tracking, and then you're talking a lot more work done on the image
Sep 14 19:27:02 <Stryker001>	so basic line/edge detection would be simpler
Sep 14 19:27:05 <Stryker001>	right?
Sep 14 19:27:10 <MPQC>	If they move the camera too fast, mind = blown
Sep 14 19:27:19 <Stryker001>	they?... me.
Sep 14 19:27:26 <Stryker001>	I wouldn't be releasing it.
Sep 14 19:27:32 <ShadyGuy>	I cant tell if this shit is FREEZING my nose or BURNING my nose
Sep 14 19:27:32 <Stryker001>	there's no market... :(
Sep 14 19:27:38 <ShadyGuy>	All i know is it feels frickin wierd
Sep 14 19:27:39 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:27:50 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:27:55 <ShadyGuy>	maybe i used too much lol
Sep 14 19:27:59 <Stryker001>	aloe?
Sep 14 19:28:02 <ShadyGuy>	yes
Sep 14 19:28:03 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:28:06 <Stryker001>	you shoulda gotten the stuf with lidocaine lol
Sep 14 19:28:11 <Stryker001>	that stuff's awesome
Sep 14 19:28:25 <Stryker001>	feels *soooo* nice
Sep 14 19:28:36 <ShadyGuy>	It was like
Sep 14 19:28:37 <ShadyGuy>	this blue gel
Sep 14 19:28:59 <Stryker001>	blue?
Sep 14 19:29:00 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:29:05 <Stryker001>	it's usually green
Sep 14 19:29:13 <ShadyGuy>	well this one wasnt
Sep 14 19:29:13 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:29:34 <Stryker001>	it's technically clear, so they can put whatever dyes they want in there.
Sep 14 19:30:08 <ShadyGuy>	I want neon allow
Sep 14 19:30:13 <ShadyGuy>	that makes my nose glow in the dark
Sep 14 19:30:14 <ShadyGuy>	aloe

Sep 14 19:31:57 <Stryker001>	hey, a bit OT: what's up with using "C" instead of "("?
Sep 14 19:32:02 <Stryker001>	I really don't get it
Sep 14 19:32:11 <MPQC>	Because it's a bigger sadface
Sep 14 19:32:13 <MPQC>	:c
Sep 14 19:32:24 <ShadyGuy>	Or bigger happy face

Sep 14 19:38:26 <ShadyGuy>	Lol?
Sep 14 19:38:28 <Stryker001>	Trying to set up port forwarding
Sep 14 19:38:34 <Stryker001>	and I needed the user/pass...
Sep 14 19:38:43 <MPQC>	If you're on WEP it's easy peazy
Sep 14 19:38:44 <Stryker001>	they said it's (usually) admin.
Sep 14 19:38:45 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:38:53 <MPQC>	Oh
Sep 14 19:38:55 <MPQC>	ic
Sep 14 19:38:57 <Stryker001>	no, I'm not cracking the passcode to connect
Sep 14 19:39:02 <Stryker001>	derp, that's easy as pie

Sep 14 19:39:14 <Stryker001>	yeah
Sep 14 19:39:23 <Stryker001>	but port forwarding os so confuscating
Sep 14 19:39:28 <MPQC>	Why lol
Sep 14 19:39:28 <ShadyGuy>	not really
Sep 14 19:39:29 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:39:32 <ShadyGuy>	Are you in the router?
Sep 14 19:39:34 <MPQC>	Insert port, insert protocol..Done
Sep 14 19:39:41 <MPQC>	Oh and ip
Sep 14 19:39:43 <Stryker001>	why? because I'm not the one who's got the [asswords.
Sep 14 19:39:49 <Stryker001>	and I've never done it before.
Sep 14 19:40:05 <Stryker001>	(where do I "insert the port"?)
Sep 14 19:40:09 <MPQC>	First time I did it I stuck it on DMZ when I was a little kid
Sep 14 19:40:17 <MPQC>	I was like "i'm totally a pro"
Sep 14 19:40:32 <Stryker001>	*just noticed "[asswords]"*
Sep 14 19:40:35 <Stryker001>	lolz

Sep 14 19:40:41 <Stryker001>	*that should be passwords...
Sep 14 19:40:44 <MPQC>	Just head off to portforward.com and find your router :P
Sep 14 19:40:45 <Stryker001>	as if you didn't know.
Sep 14 19:40:46 <MPQC>	Once you're in

Sep 14 19:41:11 <Stryker001>	just sayin'
Sep 14 19:41:17 <ShadyGuy>	HURR THATS NOT AN ANCIENT JOKE
Sep 14 19:41:20 <MPQC>	I'm totally going to vote for lemon party, they should run the country
Sep 14 19:41:47 <Stryker001>	I don't typically trust advice contained of a URL followed by colon P
Sep 14 19:41:56 <Stryker001>	usually ends up as a "shock" site
Sep 14 19:42:15 <MPQC>	I'm a mac user, and you?
Sep 14 19:42:32 <Stryker001>	soon-to-be
Sep 14 19:42:32 <Stryker001>	why?

Sep 14 19:43:37 <ShadyGuy>	She was like yeah .org's have to go through approval processes
Sep 14 19:43:38 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:43:39 <ShadyGuy>	I was like
Sep 14 19:43:40 <ShadyGuy>	Uh
Sep 14 19:43:41 <Stryker001>	I don't see the router I have on portforwarding
Sep 14 19:43:44 <ShadyGuy>	you can buy them for 10$
Sep 14 19:43:44 <ShadyGuy>	Lol
Sep 14 19:43:55 <MPQC>	I've never seen a bad .edu
Sep 14 19:44:06 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:44:15 <Stryker001>	macuser.org isn't registered (yet)
Sep 14 19:44:22 <Stryker001>	you should fix that ;)
Sep 14 19:44:22 <MPQC>	It's the :P
Sep 14 19:44:31 <MPQC>	No way I'm spending a buck for fail trolls

Sep 14 19:46:57 <Stryker001>	...what?
Sep 14 19:46:59 <Stryker001>	oh
Sep 14 19:47:01 <Stryker001>	yes
Sep 14 19:47:10 <Stryker001>	I though you were accusing me.
Sep 14 19:47:15 <Stryker001>	*slow today*
Sep 14 19:47:45 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:49:28 <Stryker001>	at least I'm faster than my computer :)
Sep 14 19:49:44 <Stryker001>	brb
Sep 14 19:49:50 <ShadyGuy>	NOU
Sep 14 19:49:51 <ShadyGuy>	okah
Sep 14 19:50:48 <Stryker001>	back
Sep 14 19:51:10 <ShadyGuy>	ohai
Sep 14 19:51:33 <MPQC>	You're faster then your computer huh
Sep 14 19:51:35 <MPQC>	Why do I not believe that :)
Sep 14 19:52:11 <Stryker001>	hmmm
Sep 14 19:52:19 <Stryker001>	because you don't understand how slow my coomputer is
Sep 14 19:52:51 <Stryker001>	it's only a 751 MHz
Sep 14 19:52:56 <ShadyGuy>	WTF
Sep 14 19:52:57 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:52:57 <Stryker001>	never seen anything slower
Sep 14 19:53:04 <Syniphas>	p. sure a computer from 30 years ago is faster than you Stryker001
Sep 14 19:53:05 <MPQC>	You haven't been alive very long hav eyou
Sep 14 19:53:11 <Stryker001>	built from free parts scavenged from the dump :P
Sep 14 19:53:15 <Syniphas>	tell me the square root of 2390739
Sep 14 19:53:17 <ShadyGuy>	Jesus christ man come out from under your rock and buy some RAM
Sep 14 19:53:19 <Stryker001>	it's about 10 yrs. old
Sep 14 19:53:20 <Syniphas>	you may not use calculators
Sep 14 19:53:23 <Stryker001>	lol
Sep 14 19:53:30 <Syniphas>	ShadyGuy i want to punch you so much right now
Sep 14 19:53:35 <Syniphas>	and i mean it
Sep 14 19:53:45 <Stryker001>	ram, i've got about ...3/4 gig ram.
Sep 14 19:53:51 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:54:00 <Stryker001>	I don't want to punch him... he's right
Sep 14 19:54:04 <Syniphas>	why does everybody think buying ram will make their computer magically faster
Sep 14 19:54:06 <Syniphas>	No he isn't.
Sep 14 19:54:09 <Stryker001>	but instead, I'm buying a MacBook air. :P
Sep 14 19:54:24 <MPQC>	I've often wondered that, I never get the out of memory error so I have no reason to get more ram lmao
Sep 14 19:54:30 <MPQC>	2gb seems plenty
Sep 14 19:54:31 <ShadyGuy>	I didnt realize the whole computer was that old until he said it either
Sep 14 19:54:31 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:54:32 <Syniphas>	also, I really doubt you have a 751mhz computer with more RAM than my 1.8ghz dual core
Sep 14 19:54:37 <ShadyGuy>	Get a new processor too
Sep 14 19:54:39 <ShadyGuy>	C:
Sep 14 19:54:43 <ShadyGuy>	Actually at this rate
Sep 14 19:54:47 <Syniphas>	also Stryker001 i thought you wanted a new computer
Sep 14 19:54:48 <ShadyGuy>	Just scrap the whole thing and get a new one
Sep 14 19:54:48 <ShadyGuy>	lol
Sep 14 19:54:50 <Stryker001>	also, I really doubt you have a 751mhz computer with more RAM than my 1.8ghz dual core... what?
Sep 14 19:54:52 <Syniphas>	why are you buying a macbook air
Sep 14 19:55:29 <MPQC>	To look cool
Sep 14 19:55:35 <Stryker001>	no
Sep 14 19:55:41 <Stryker001>	because it's the most cost-efficient
Sep 14 19:55:44 <MPQC>	What I noticed at my university is all the black people have macs, all the whites have windows
Sep 14 19:55:45 <Syniphas>	To slice bread
Sep 14 19:55:46 <Stryker001>	(go ahes, laugh)
Sep 14 19:55:47 <MPQC>	I'm not trying to be racist
Sep 14 19:55:49 <MPQC>	But it's what I've picked up
Sep 14 19:55:52 <Syniphas>	Stryker001
Sep 14 19:56:00 <Syniphas>	it's... really not cost efficient at all
Sep 14 19:56:04 <Stryker001>	I dare you to find a better deal than what I'm getting
Sep 14 19:56:17 <MPQC>	Show us the specs and I'll find a better
Sep 14 19:56:22 <Syniphas>	all you can do with a macbook air is probably post on your narcissistic blog about hipster stuffs
Sep 14 19:56:23 <Stryker001>	Dell is offering the"same" thing (their new XPS).
Sep 14 19:56:28 <Stryker001>	it's about 200 dollars more
Sep 14 19:56:34 <Stryker001>	and it's running windows.
Sep 14 19:56:35 <Stryker001>	'nuff said.
Sep 14 19:56:35 <Syniphas>	i don't feel like dealing with computer illiteracy right now
Sep 14 19:56:36 <MPQC>	XPS Are overpriced shit
Sep 14 19:56:37 <MPQC>	Same with Alienware
Sep 14 19:56:40 <Syniphas>	MPQC, you think you got this?
Sep 14 19:56:43 <MPQC>	They're all scams
Sep 14 19:56:45 <MPQC>	I got this :P
Sep 14 19:56:48 <Syniphas>	alright
Sep 14 19:56:54 <Stryker001>	*yawn*
Sep 14 19:56:56 <Syniphas>	call me if it gets too hot-headed in here
Sep 14 19:56:59 <Syniphas>	see ya guys later
Sep 14 19:57:01 <MPQC>	lol
Sep 14 19:57:08 <Stryker001>	lolz
Sep 14 19:57:19 <Stryker001>	we could just PM the whole thing so you don't have to leave
Sep 14 19:57:29 <Syniphas>	i'm not leaving because of that
Sep 14 19:57:38 <Syniphas>	i'd switch windows and forget about this channel either way
Sep 14 19:57:38 <Stryker001>	good :)
Sep 14 19:57:44 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 19:57:54 <Stryker001>	so *anyways*
Sep 14 19:57:55 <Syniphas>	have fun with your little mac vs. pc fight
Sep 14 19:57:55 <MPQC>	http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss15/Stiannius/macproWTF-1.jpg
Sep 14 19:58:00 <MPQC>	My macs better then yours
Sep 14 19:58:04 <Stryker001>	I really like the large touchpad, for one.
Sep 14 19:58:13 <Stryker001>	I'm having a hard time finding that on a PC.
Sep 14 19:58:25 <Syniphas>	i really like the MOUSE
Sep 14 19:58:33 <Syniphas>	mac or pc, fuck touchpads
Sep 14 19:58:35 <Stryker001>	mouse =/= multitouch
Sep 14 19:58:45 <MPQC>	Why do you need multitouch
Sep 14 19:58:47 <Stryker001>	I write multitouch software
Sep 14 19:58:47 <Syniphas>	multitouch =/= computers
Sep 14 19:58:48 <MPQC>	So you can zoom in?
Sep 14 19:58:54 <Stryker001>	no.
Sep 14 19:58:57 <Stryker001>	much better.
Sep 14 19:58:58 <Syniphas>	you want a multitouch? buy a fucking smartphone
Sep 14 19:59:04 <ShadyGuy>	ohai
Sep 14 19:59:09 <Stryker001>	ohai
Sep 14 19:59:11 <ShadyGuy>	obai
Sep 14 19:59:17 <Stryker001>	kthxbai
Sep 14 19:59:20 <--	ShadyGuy has quit (Quit: KVIrc 4.0.4 Insomnia http://www.kvirc.net/)
Sep 14 19:59:24 <Stryker001>	so anyways
Sep 14 19:59:28 <MPQC>	olol
Sep 14 19:59:29 <Stryker001>	I already have a phone
Sep 14 19:59:33 <Stryker001>	tyvm
Sep 14 19:59:40 <Stryker001>	I need a new computer, not a phone
Sep 14 19:59:56 <Stryker001>	so the touch pad is just one determining factor.
Sep 14 20:00:04 <Stryker001>	the next was the battery life.
Sep 14 20:00:16 <Stryker001>	I know the dells SUCK when it ocmes to battery.
Sep 14 20:00:18 <Stryker001>	*comes
Sep 14 20:00:45 <Stryker001>	but I haven't really tried any other laptop brands to know about HP, Compaq, GateWay, etc/
Sep 14 20:00:49 <Syniphas>	you know why the macbook air has good battery life?
Sep 14 20:00:50 <Stryker001>	any thoughts?
Sep 14 20:00:53 <Syniphas>	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO SHIT
Sep 14 20:01:00 <Syniphas>	it's an oversized netbook
Sep 14 20:01:08 <Stryker001>	it does more than what I have now.
Sep 14 20:01:09 <Syniphas>	have fun with optical media
Sep 14 20:01:10 <MPQC>	I'm on a toshiba, and I say it's the best laptop I've ever owned
Sep 14 20:01:15 <Syniphas>	and pretty much EVERYTHING ELSE
Sep 14 20:01:19 -->	emusan (~chatzilla@F4CA4272.FBAD36FA.948DB4A3.IP) has joined #nD
Sep 14 20:01:21 <MPQC>	I've tried only Dell, HP, Compaq and Asus

Sep 14 20:01:44 <Stryker001>	everytime I use one, I hate it.
Sep 14 20:01:48 <Stryker001>	yeah, same here!
Sep 14 20:01:48 <MPQC>	They are fantastic lol
Sep 14 20:01:50 <Stryker001>	:)
Sep 14 20:01:59 <Stryker001>	I can't stand their keyboards...
Sep 14 20:02:09 <Stryker001>	which leads me to another major buying factor.
Sep 14 20:02:14 <MPQC>	Meh
Sep 14 20:02:14 <Stryker001>	the Apple keyboards.
Sep 14 20:02:16 <MPQC>	I love it :P
Sep 14 20:02:34 <Stryker001>	I fell in love with them before I even knew that Apples were mainstream :3
Sep 14 20:02:49 <Stryker001>	so touchpad, keyboard, and battery like

Sep 14 20:03:03 <MPQC>	The only apple keyboards I liked were the old macintosh ones
Sep 14 20:03:06 <MPQC>	Those things had serious "click" to them
Sep 14 20:03:08 <emusan>	cause silent is for pussies :P
Sep 14 20:03:09 <MPQC>	Was fantastic
Sep 14 20:03:10 <Stryker001>	lolz
Sep 14 20:03:14 <emusan>	this one has epic click

Sep 14 20:03:23 <Stryker001>	my mom h8s click
Sep 14 20:03:25 <Stryker001>	:P
Sep 14 20:03:31 <Stryker001>	so anyways....
Sep 14 20:03:42 <MPQC>	My girlfriend hates the click, she's like "all I hear is click click click since you type so fast, it's depressing"
Sep 14 20:03:43 <Syniphas>	i would LOVE a clicky keyboard
Sep 14 20:03:50 <emusan>	they expensive :(
Sep 14 20:03:52 <Stryker001>	the next major buying factor was something with an i5/i7
Sep 14 20:03:55 <emusan>	it was my graduation gift lol
Sep 14 20:03:56 <Syniphas>	everyone else in the house would be mad
Sep 14 20:04:03 <Stryker001>	the Dslls are just crazy expensive when it comes to that
Sep 14 20:04:08 <Stryker001>	*dells

Sep 14 20:04:27 <Stryker001>	laptop

Sep 14 20:04:37 <emusan>	or apple
Sep 14 20:04:40 <Stryker001>	the next factor was the boot-up time.
Sep 14 20:04:42 <emusan>	honestly I would go with apple
Sep 14 20:04:49 <emusan>	and trash the shit OS
Sep 14 20:04:49 <Stryker001>	yup
Sep 14 20:04:59 <MPQC>	I still say get a Toshiba
Sep 14 20:05:02 <emusan>	and with student prices they aren't actually /too/ bad
Sep 14 20:05:03 <Stryker001>	the boot time is *AWESOME* with SSDs.
Sep 14 20:05:08 <Stryker001>	toshiba don't have those
Sep 14 20:05:19 <Syniphas>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9435923/pics/keyboard.jpg

Sep 14 20:05:29 <Stryker001>	lastly, I really wanted something that could play well with Photoshop.
Sep 14 20:05:34 <Syniphas>	AT, 1992
Sep 14 20:05:34 <emusan>	mac

Sep 16 18:18:41 <MPQC>	My roommate put our houses temperature at 30c
Sep 16 18:18:46 <traeak>	youch
Sep 16 18:18:48 <MPQC>	I walked in and it was like walking into a wall of heat
Sep 16 18:18:48 <traeak>	heater ?
Sep 16 18:18:51 <MPQC>	Yeah
Sep 16 18:18:59 <emusan>	I would turn the heat to ~0c
Sep 16 18:19:00 <traeak>	hmm
Sep 16 18:19:02 <emusan>	or less
Sep 16 18:19:11 <MPQC>	I have my rooms heat at 0, got my tower fan on and window open lol
Sep 16 18:19:14 <traeak>	i like to keep it at bout 15C or so honestly
Sep 16 18:19:20 <MPQC>	Yeah
Sep 16 18:19:26 <MPQC>	If it's above 20, it's way too hot
Sep 16 18:19:29 <traeak>	wife isn't fond of that temp though
Sep 16 18:19:29 <emusan>	I like as cold as possible
Sep 16 18:19:47 <emusan>	I leave my window open winter
Sep 16 18:20:00 <emusan>	closed in the summer thanks to central air conditioning
Sep 16 18:20:23 <MPQC>	I like leaving my window closed but blinds open
Sep 16 18:20:30 <MPQC>	Cold gets in nicely, makes it a nice temperature
Sep 16 18:20:30 <emusan>	traeak, are you in IEEE?
Sep 16 18:20:56 <emusan>	uh, if you're losing heat with your window closed that's a problem...
Sep 16 18:21:21 <MPQC>	No, go touch your window in the winter, it'll always be cold lol
Sep 16 18:21:29 <emusan>	that's different
Sep 16 18:21:35 <emusan>	that's because glass conducts heat
Sep 16 18:21:43 <MPQC>	Exactly :P
Sep 16 18:21:46 <emusan>	but if you're room is losing heat it's more than just the surface
Sep 16 18:21:57 <emusan>	you could build a house of glass and the inside could still be warm
Sep 16 18:22:04 <emusan>	same goes for metals
Sep 16 18:22:09 <MPQC>	Meh, then my room had a leak
Sep 16 18:22:11 <MPQC>	I liked it =p

Sep 18 18:32:37 <emusan>	anything new on the nD front?
Sep 18 18:42:39 <gBev>	lol nd
Sep 18 18:47:28 <emusan>	lol
Sep 18 18:47:36 <emusan>	so no secrets that only the admins get to hear?
Sep 18 18:48:29 <Treeki>	I had completely forgotten that the nD existed
Sep 18 18:50:54 <Syniphas>	hi i broke up with my boyfriend can this be "let's all comfort syniphas" chatroom for a while
Sep 18 18:53:31 <Treeki>	:\ I'm sorry..
Sep 18 18:53:58 <Syniphas>	i'm not even upset about the breakup
Sep 18 18:54:22 <Syniphas>	our relationship was sort of hurting the both of us since we're too much alike and weren't exactly working out very well together
Sep 18 18:54:36 <Syniphas>	so we mutually agreed on ending it and we both felt relieved for that
Sep 18 18:54:38 <Syniphas>	it's just
Sep 18 18:54:41 <Syniphas>	now i kinda miss him
Sep 18 18:57:14 <emusan>	you're gay?
Sep 18 18:57:18 <emusan>	lol sorry, I didn't know...
Sep 18 18:57:26 <Syniphas>	bisexual
Sep 18 18:57:27 <emusan>	sorry to hear about that...
Sep 18 18:57:36 <emusan>	lol I iz bi too...
Sep 18 18:57:47 <emusan>	never been in a relationship though :(
Sep 18 18:58:04 <emusan>	just told one person in real life that I'm bi and that was only 4 days ago lol
Sep 18 18:58:55 <emusan>	I'm sure you and your former bf can still be friends though right?
Sep 18 18:59:02 <emusan>	or do you miss things that a friend can't do?
Sep 18 18:59:24 <Syniphas>	we're still friends... i miss the latter...
Sep 18 19:19:50 <emusan>	my tutee just quit on me
Sep 18 19:20:03 <emusan>	not only that, he was a fucking dick about it...
Sep 18 19:20:31 <Exophase>	Your what now?
Sep 18 19:22:32 <emusan>	tutee
Sep 18 19:22:35 <emusan>	someone that is tutored
Sep 18 19:22:56 <emusan>	here's a small quote from his email: "I felt like I had to run the session"
Sep 18 19:23:06 <emusan>	such BS right there
Sep 18 19:23:30 <emusan>	the tutor has no idea about the knowledge of those he/she tutors
Sep 18 19:23:40 <emusan>	how is the tutor supposed to run the session???
Sep 18 19:26:41 <emusan>	the guy was taking calculus based physics without any background in calculus
Sep 18 19:26:49 <emusan>	I had no legal obligation to teach him at that point
Sep 18 19:28:58 <Exophase>	This is why classes have prereqs..
Sep 18 19:29:20 <emusan>	yeah...
Sep 18 19:29:32 <emusan>	I guess the course doesn't "technically" need you to have a background in calculus though
Sep 18 19:29:53 <emusan>	even though it expects you to go from position->velocity->acceleration
Sep 18 19:29:57 <emusan>	I guess "magically"
Sep 18 19:31:49 <Exophase>	Yeah I dunn emusan, that doesn't sound like Calculus-based physics.
Sep 18 19:32:02 <emusan>	that was from the 2nd week
Sep 18 19:32:07 <emusan>	oh you're kidding lol
Sep 18 19:32:09 <Exophase>	I've taken physics courses w/o calc prereqs, if someone tried to use Calculus to tutor me in those I probably wouldn't take to it either..
Sep 18 19:32:11 <emusan>	are you?
Sep 18 19:32:14 <Exophase>	No, I'm not kidding.
Sep 18 19:32:19 <emusan>	?
Sep 18 19:32:37 <Exophase>	I'm saying that you can teach physics with calculus (and therefore should require it) and you can teach it without.
Sep 18 19:32:47 <emusan>	how would you get from a position graph to a velocity graph without knowing it's the slope?
Sep 18 19:32:48 <Exophase>	You won't get the same depth without, and it won't be as natural.
Sep 18 19:33:34 <emusan>	I guess part of the problem was I never took the college course
Sep 18 19:33:50 <Exophase>	In Newtonian physics there are a few simple equations relating position, velocity, and acceleration, I'm sure that people are just taught to memorize them...
Sep 18 19:33:53 <emusan>	but the one I took in highschool which should have been nearly equivalent did requrie a lot of calculus
Sep 18 19:34:05 <emusan>	yes, but those only work in some cases
Sep 18 19:34:30 <emusan>	and once you get to work, torque, etc. it all gets blown out of the water
Sep 18 19:34:37 <Exophase>	Nope.
Sep 18 19:34:57 <Exophase>	Just more equations, without the principles of calc..
Sep 18 19:35:07 <emusan>	moment of inertia then
Sep 18 19:35:12 <emusan>	that /requires/ calculus
Sep 18 19:35:23 <Exophase>	Why don't you go look through his text book and tell me if it ever directly uses calculus.
Sep 18 19:35:24 <emusan>	and is covered in mechanical physics
Sep 18 19:35:35 <emusan>	well the textbook and lectures do for sure
Sep 18 19:35:37 <emusan>	to derive the stuff
Sep 18 19:35:42 <Exophase>	Did you see them?
Sep 18 19:35:48 <emusan>	yes, I had the same one
Sep 18 19:35:52 <emusan>	last year...
Sep 18 19:36:01 <emusan>	I'm tutoring a few people
Sep 18 19:36:04 <Exophase>	You had the same lectures in a totally different class?
Sep 18 19:36:09 <emusan>	this guy was the only one that couldn't get a lot of this stuff
Sep 18 19:36:13 <emusan>	no, I had the same textbook
Sep 18 19:36:40 <emusan>	as for the lectures I would assume the professor derives equations most of the time
Sep 18 19:36:52 <emusan>	that's all I've ever done in any of my physics lectures
Sep 18 19:36:53 <Exophase>	All I'm saying is, if the course assumes a background in calculus and doesn't have it as a prereq then they've massively fucked up.
Sep 18 19:37:12 <Exophase>	And I'm telling you with absolute certainty that colleges do offer physics courses without an ounce of Calc
Sep 18 19:37:15 <emusan>	it "highly recommends" a background in calculus
Sep 18 19:37:22 <emusan>	yes, those are the 1** courses
Sep 18 19:37:25 <emusan>	this is 212
Sep 18 19:37:39 <emusan>	lemme actually look it up though
Sep 18 19:37:56 <Exophase>	Anyway, if he doesn't know calc and he needs to know it for this course shouldn't you be trying to teach him that?
Sep 18 19:38:39 <emusan>	okay...
Sep 18 19:38:47 <emusan>	Prereq: PHY 211, 221 Coreq: PHY 222, MAT 286 or MAT 296 
Sep 18 19:38:57 <emusan>	tutors aren't supposed to teach
Sep 18 19:39:02 <emusan>	and I did teach him integrals
Sep 18 19:39:07 <emusan>	but I'm not a math tutor
Sep 18 19:39:08 <Exophase>	Tutors aren't supposed to teach?
Sep 18 19:39:18 <emusan>	no, we are supposed to reinforce knowledge
Sep 18 19:39:22 <emusan>	maybe teach a little
Sep 18 19:39:23 <Exophase>	wut
Sep 18 19:39:28 <emusan>	but all of calculus 1+2
Sep 18 19:39:29 <emusan>	??
Sep 18 19:39:34 <Exophase>	You're supposed to try.
Sep 18 19:39:37 <emusan>	we meet twice a week for one hour
Sep 18 19:40:08 <emusan>	it takes most students 4 hours a week for a semester to really learn calc
Sep 18 19:40:38 <Exophase>	So maybe you should take it up with the department chair if they messed up the prereqs.
Sep 18 19:40:48 <emusan>	no, he explained it to me
Sep 18 19:40:51 <Exophase>	Then again, I don't know what the prereqs were for the prereqs, nor do I know what those coreqs are.
Sep 18 19:40:56 <emusan>	he had permission for the course
Sep 18 19:41:03 <emusan>	I don't know how
Sep 18 19:41:24 <Exophase>	So is he a sophomore?
Sep 18 19:41:28 <emusan>	but even all that aside, the guy asked me to do his homework for him multiple times
Sep 18 19:41:33 <emusan>	which is illegal for me to do
Sep 18 19:41:45 <emusan>	he's on his 4th semester
Sep 18 19:41:48 <emusan>	he said he took one off
Sep 18 19:42:01 <Exophase>	So this is generally a second year class or what?
Sep 18 19:42:19 <emusan>	yeah
Sep 18 19:42:21 <emusan>	supposed to be
Sep 18 19:42:28 <Exophase>	Are they short on tutors?
Sep 18 19:42:37 <emusan>	I'm one of very few physics tutors lol
Sep 18 19:42:44 <emusan>	I dunno why
Sep 18 19:43:07 <emusan>	I might have to stop though
Sep 18 19:43:24 <emusan>	not cause this guy, but I just don't know about my time right now
Sep 18 19:44:12 <emusan>	lol one of the other people I tutor says I'm really helpful...
Sep 18 19:44:21 <emusan>	so I dunno what this guys problem was
Sep 18 19:44:30 <emusan>	and I did go over integrals and derivatives
Sep 18 19:44:33 <emusan>	but w/e
Sep 18 19:44:58 <Exophase>	Well maybe you should talk to whoever gave him "permission"
Sep 18 19:45:08 <Exophase>	Because it seems like someone fucked up here.
Sep 18 19:45:19 <emusan>	I don't think finding that out would be easy lol
Sep 18 19:45:23 <emusan>	I really don't care enough
Sep 18 19:45:39 <emusan>	the guy will get another tutor and if that tutor isn't a professor then the guy is just fucked
Sep 18 19:45:49 <emusan>	and at this point I'm fine with that
Sep 18 19:45:57 <emusan>	I will send my boss an email though
Sep 18 19:46:15 <emusan>	dunno quite what to write, but I don't want to write it while pissed either lol
Sep 18 19:49:08 <emusan>	so, exophase, what have you been up to lately?
Sep 18 19:49:14 <Exophase>	Nothing good.
Sep 18 19:49:33 <emusan>	you a gangster now?
Sep 18 19:49:35 <emusan>	lol
Sep 18 19:51:36 <emusan>	one of my sutemates keeps having parties :(
Sep 18 19:51:40 <emusan>	in our common room
Sep 18 19:54:09 <Exophase>	Yes. I'm a gangster now.
Sep 18 19:56:27 <emusan>	up to no good
Sep 18 19:56:35 <emusan>	poppin caps!
Sep 18 20:00:34 <emusan>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x5ZRAVXxr8
Sep 18 20:00:36 <emusan>	I post that here yet?
Sep 18 20:00:45 <emusan>	oh, I think I did
Sep 18 20:00:53 <emusan>	I dunno if anyone saw it though
